///   * start and end date of the staking period (the earlier you enter, and
///     the longer you stay, the greater your overall reward)
///
///   * At each point, the the current reward is described by a downward curve
///     (https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dz8vk1urep)
///
///   * Computing your total reward (which is done upfront in order to lock and
///     guarantee your reward) means computing the integral of the curve period from
///     your enter date until the end
///     (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+%28100-x%29%5E2)
///
///   * This integral is the one being calculated in the `integralAtPoint` function
///
///   * Besides this rule, rewards are also capped by a maximum percentage
///     provided at contract instantiation time (a cap of 40 means your maximum
///     possible reward is 40% of your initial stake
