/**
 * @title LS1DebtAccounting
 * @author dYdX
 *
 * @dev Allows converting an overdue balance into "debt", which is accounted for separately from
 *  the staked and borrowed balances. This allows the system to rebalance/restabilize itself in the
 *  case where a borrower fails to return borrowed funds on time.
 *
 *  The shortfall debt calculation is as follows:
 *
 *    - Let A be the total active balance.
 *    - Let B be the total borrowed balance.
 *    - Let X be the total inactive balance.
 *    - Then, a shortfall occurs if at any point B > A.
 *    - The shortfall debt amount is `D = B - A`
 *    - The borrowed balances are decreased by `B_new = B - D`
 *    - The inactive balances are decreased by `X_new = X - D`
 *    - The shortfall index is recorded as `Y = X_new / X`
 *    - The borrower and staker debt balances are increased by `D`
 *
 *  Note that `A + X >= B` (The active and inactive balances are at least the borrowed balance.)
 *  This implies that `X >= D` (The inactive balance is always at least the shortfall debt.)
