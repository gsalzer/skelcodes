/**
 * @title LS1Rewards
 * @author dYdX
 *
 * @dev Manages the distribution of token rewards.
 *
 *  Rewards are distributed continuously. After each second, an account earns rewards `r` according
 *  to the following formula:
 *
 *      r = R * s / S
 *
 *  Where:
 *    - `R` is the rewards distributed globally each second, also called the “emission rate.”
 *    - `s` is the account's staked balance in that second (technically, it is measured at the
 *      end of the second)
 *    - `S` is the sum total of all staked balances in that second (again, measured at the end of
 *      the second)
 *
 *  The parameter `R` can be configured by the contract owner. For every second that elapses,
 *  exactly `R` tokens will accrue to users, save for rounding errors, and with the exception that
 *  while the total staked balance is zero, no tokens will accrue to anyone.
 *
 *  The accounting works as follows: A global index is stored which represents the cumulative
 *  number of rewards tokens earned per staked token since the start of the distribution.
 *  The value of this index increases over time, and there are two factors affecting the rate of
 *  increase:
 *    1) The emission rate (in the numerator)
 *    2) The total number of staked tokens (in the denominator)
 *
 *  Whenever either factor changes, in some timestamp T, we settle the global index up to T by
 *  calculating the increase in the index since the last update using the OLD values of the factors:
 *
 *    indexDelta = timeDelta * emissionPerSecond * INDEX_BASE / totalStaked
 *
 *  Where `INDEX_BASE` is a scaling factor used to allow more precision in the storage of the index.
 *
 *  For each user we store an accrued rewards balance, as well as a user index, which is a cache of
 *  the global index at the time that the user's accrued rewards balance was last updated. Then at
 *  any point in time, a user's claimable rewards are represented by the following:
 *
 *    rewards = _USER_REWARDS_BALANCES_[user] + userStaked * (
 *                settledGlobalIndex - _USER_INDEXES_[user]
 *              ) / INDEX_BASE
