/**
 * @title Token Locking
 *
 * @notice A token holder contract that can release its token balance gradually like a
 *      typical vesting scheme, with a cliff and vesting period.
 * @notice Supports token staking for the tokens locked; staking is powered by IlluviumLockedPool (locked tokens pool)
 *
 * @notice Smart contract is deployed/initialized in 4 steps. During the initialization period the
 *      deployer is able to set locked token holders' balances and finally set the locked tokens pool
 *      to enable staking. Once final step is complete the deployer no longer can do that.
 *
 * @dev To initialize:
 *      1) deploy this smart contract (prerequisite: ILV token deployed)
 *      2) set the locked token holders and balances with `setBalances`
 *      3) transfer ILV in the amount equal to the sum of all holders' balances to the deployed instance
 *      4) [optional] set the Locked Token Pool with `setPool` (staking won't work until this is done)
 *
 * @dev The purpose of steps 2 and 3 is to have team and pre-seed investors tokens locked immediately,
 *      without giving them an ability not to lock them; in the same time we preserve an ability to stake
 *      these locked tokens
 *
 * @dev TokenLocking contract works with the token amount up to 10^7, which makes it safe
 *      to use uint96 for token amounts in the contract
 *
 * @dev Inspired by OpenZeppelin's TokenVesting.sol draft

     *          version and salt are omitted:
     *          {

     *              verifyingContract: <deployed TokenLocking address>
     *          }
     *      2. Construct the EIP712 domainSeparator:
     *          domainSeparator = hashStruct(eip712Domain)
     *      3. Construct the EIP721 TypedData:
     *          primaryType: "Migration",

     *              Migration: [

     *              ]
     *          }
     *      4. Build the message to sign:
     *          {
     *              from: _from,
     *              to: _to,

     *              exp: _exp
     *          }
     *       5. Build the structHash as per EIP712 and sign it
