/**
 * @title Intelligent NFT (iNFT)
 *        Version 1
 *
 * @notice Intelligent NFT (iNFT) represents an enhancement to an existing NFT
 *      (we call it a "target" or "target NFT"), it binds a GPT-3 prompt (a "personality prompt")
 *      to the target to embed intelligence, is controlled and belongs to the owner of the target.
 *
 * @notice iNFT stores AI Pod and some amount of ALI tokens locked, available to
 *      unlocking when iNFT is destroyed
 *
 * @notice iNFT is not an ERC721 token, but it has some very limited similarity to an ERC721:
 *      every record is identified by ID and this ID has an owner, which is effectively the target NFT owner;
 *      still, it doesn't store ownership information itself and fully relies on the target ownership instead
 *
 * @dev Internally iNFTs consist of:
 *      - personality prompt - a GPT-3 prompt defining its intelligent capabilities
 *      - target NFT - smart contract address and ID of the NFT the iNFT is bound to
 *      - AI Pod - ID of the AI Pod used to produce given iNFT, locked within an iNFT
 *      - ALI tokens amount - amount of the ALI tokens used to produce given iNFT, also locked
 *
 * @dev iNFTs can be
 *      - created, this process requires an AI Pod and ALI tokens to be locked
 *      - destroyed, this process releases an AI Pod and ALI tokens previously locked;
 *         ALI token fee may get withheld upon destruction
 *
 * @dev Some known limitations of Version 1:
 *      - doesn't support ERC1155 as a target NFT
 *      - only one-to-one iNFT-NFT bindings,
 *         no many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many bindings not allowed
 *      - no AI Pod ID -> iNFT ID binding, impossible to look for iNFT by AI Pod ID
 *      - no enumeration support, iNFT IDs created must be tracked off-chain,
 *         or [recommended] generated with a predictable deterministic integer sequence,
 *         for example, 1, 2, 3, ...
 *      - no support for personality prompt upgrades (no way to update personality prompt)
 *      - burn: doesn't allow to specify where to send the iNFT burning fee, sends ALI tokens
 *         burner / transaction sender (iNFT Linker)
 *      - burn: doesn't verify if its safe to send ALI tokens released back to NFT owner;
 *         ALI tokens may get lost if iNFT is burnt when NFT belongs to a smart contract which
 *         is not aware of the ALI tokens being sent to it
 *      - no target NFT ID optimization; storage usage for IntelliBinding can be optimized
 *         if short target NFT IDs are recognized and stored optimized
 *      - AI Pod ERC721 and ALI ERC20 smart contracts are set during the deployment and cannot be changed
