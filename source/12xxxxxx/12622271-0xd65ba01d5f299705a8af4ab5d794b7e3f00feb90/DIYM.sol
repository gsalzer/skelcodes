/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

 * @notice Each token holder is an official member of the MBA. The initial supply of token holders is 7 as of June 7, 2021.
 * Tokens are ERC20 compatible, and may be transferred to other wallets. Multiple tokens may be held by one address.

 * If a new member is successfully inducted, a new DIYM coin will be minted and sent to that member's address.
 * @dev Note this inherits from the openzeppelin v 4.1.0 ERC20 contract
 * Initial supply is determined by constructor parameters. After the initial supply, the initial token holder should transfer individual tokens to individual members or remain the custodian of these tokens.
 * Voting process works in the following manner:
 *     1. A token holder calls the voteForNewMember method with the proposed member's address. 
 *      This stores a new proposed member instance, which keeps track of the current "for" votes for the member ("against" votes are not supported)
 *     2. At any point in time anyone can call the inductNewMember method which will tally up "for" votes for the member to determine if enough "for" votes have been cast (more than half).
 *      Tallying sums up all of the current holdings of addresses that have voted for the new member (addresses may have 0, 1, or more tokens as token transfers may have occured after voting).
 *      If more than half of the total supply of tokens have voted for the new member, that member will be minted a new token.
