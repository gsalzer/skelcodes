/**
 * @title Interface to access APY.Finance's address registry
 * @author APY.Finance
 * @notice The address registry has two important purposes, one which
 *         is fairly concrete and another abstract.
 *
 *         1. The registry enables components of the APY.Finance system
 *         and external systems to retrieve core addresses reliably
 *         even when the functionality may move to a different
 *         address.
 *
 *         2. The registry also makes explicit which contracts serve
 *         as primary entrypoints for interacting with different
 *         components.  Not every contract is registered here, only
 *         the ones properly deserving of an identifier.  This helps
 *         define explicit boundaries between groups of contracts,
 *         each of which is logically cohesive.
