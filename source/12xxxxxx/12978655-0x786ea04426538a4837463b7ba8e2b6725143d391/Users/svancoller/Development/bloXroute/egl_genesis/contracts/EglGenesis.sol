/** 
 * EGL Staking Notice
 * 
 * By agreeing to stake Ethereum:
 * - You agree that staked Ethereum will be locked up for a specified duration, will not be retrievable for that 
 * period, and that any staking of tokens has various associated risks.
 * 
 * - You are obligated to maintain balancer pool tokens  in a Balancer pool containing ETH and EGL for between 10 and
 * 52 weeks. The resulting balancer pool tokens will be held by the EGL smart contract, and gradually released to the
 * Genesis supporters, as specified further here: https://docs.egl.vote/protocol-overview/launch.
 * 
 * - You agree to consume EGL and utilize the tokens for voting purposes, as summarized here: 
 * https://docs.egl.vote/protocol-overview/voting. For users who fail to vote, the protocol may take certain actions by
 * default that may impact the price of the Ethereum gas limit and/or impact EGL. EGL is intended to be immediately 
 * consumed by advanced Ethereum developers and stakeholders; utilize it at your own discretion and risk. EGL is 
 * intended solely as a means of collective voting on the Ethereum gas limit; users should have no expectations of 
 * profits.
 * 
 * - You understand and agree that EGL is a decentralized, open source project, so that the parameters of the protocol 
 * and the code base itself can change, including core technical features and material properties of the token.
 * 
 * - While we hope it never happens, you understand and agree that the staking of tokens is a non-custodial arrangement 
 * that has technical and financial risks, including risk of inaccessibility, decreases in value, and complete loss. 
 * You understand and agree that under no circumstances shall the developers of this smart contract or contributors to 
 * EGL be liable for any loss or damage you might experience.
 * 
 * By staking Ethereum or accessing or otherwise using this smart contract, you agree that you have read and 
 * understood, and, as a condition of your use of the smart contract, you agree to be bound by these terms.
