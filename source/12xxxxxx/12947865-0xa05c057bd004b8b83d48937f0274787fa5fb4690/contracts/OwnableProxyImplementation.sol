/**
 * @dev Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * This is a modified implementation of OpenZeppelin's Ownable.sol.
 * The modifications allow the contract to be inherited by a proxy's logic contract.
 * Any owner-only functions on the base implementation will be unusable.
 *
 * By default, the owner account will be a null address which can be set by invoking
 * a function with the `initializer` modifier. The owner can later be changed with
 * {transferOwnership}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 * the owner. It also makes available the `initializer` modifier, which will set
 * the owner to `msg.sender` the first time the function is invoked, and will
 * revert if the owner has already been set.
 *
 * Note: This contract should only be inherited by proxy implementation contracts
 * where the implementation will only ever be used as the logic address for proxies.
 * The constructor permanently locks the owner of the implementation contract, but the
 * owner of the proxies can be configured by the first caller.
