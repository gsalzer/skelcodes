/**
 * @title ERC721FairDistribution
 * @author this-is-obvs
 *
 * @notice ERC721 base contract supporting a fair and random distribution of tokens, with a fixed
 *  minting price. The owner of the contract is responsible for ensuring that the NFT works are
 *  stored in decentralized storage, and provably linked to this contract via _provenanceHash.
 *
 *  The following events should happen in order, coordinated by the contract owner:
 *    1. The pre-sale begins, during which tokens may be purchased, but the NFT pieces have not yet
 *       been revealed.
 *    2. The _provenanceHash is finalized on-chain, acting as a commitment to the content and
 *       metadata of the NFT series, as well as the order of original sequence IDs.
 *    3. A starting index is chosen pseudorandomly and is used to determine how the NFT token IDs
 *       are mapped to original sequence IDs. This helps to ensure a fair distribution.
 *    4. The NFT pieces are revealed, by updating the _baseTokenUri.
 *    5. After the conclusion of the sale, it is recommended that the contract owner renounce
 *       ownership, to prevent further changes to the _baseTokenUri or _provenanceHash. Before
 *       giving up ownership, the owner may call pauseMinting(), if necessary, to cap the supply.
 *
 *  The starting index is determined pseudorandomly using a recent block hash once one of the
 *  following occurs:
 *    1. The last token is purchased; OR
 *    2. The first token is purchased after the _presaleEnd timestamp; OR
 *    3. If either of the above takes too long to occur, the owner may take manual action to ensure
 *       that the starting index is chosen promptly.
 *
 *  Once the starting index is chosen, each NFT token ID is mapped to an original sequence ID
 *  according to the formula:
 *
 *    Original Sequence ID = (NFT Token ID + Starting Index) % Max Supply
