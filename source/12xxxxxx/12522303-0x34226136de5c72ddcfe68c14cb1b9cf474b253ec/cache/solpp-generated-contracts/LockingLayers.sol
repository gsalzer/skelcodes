/**
 * @dev LockingLayers is an ERC721 contract that contains the logic and source of ownership
 * for Whole Picture. The core mechanics breakdown as follows:
 *   - Each artwork consists of 4 layers. 
 *   - A Layer contain a canvasId.
 *   - Each layer shifts its canvasId after X blocks, unless the layer is locked.
 *   - Layers are revealed over time, and the entire process ends after all layers are revelaed and
 *     all layer shifts have finished.
 *   
 * Schema is:
 *   - artworkId => owned by address
 *     - canvasIds[NUM_LAYERS] => owned by artwork => NUM_LAYERS = 4 so each artwork ownes 4 canvasIds
 *
 * Layer Mappings:
 *   - Mappings from canvasId => canvas are stored offchain in IPFS. Mapping json file can be viewed
 *   - at ipfs://QmZ7Lpf5T4NhawAKsWAmomG5sxkSN6USfRVRW5nMzjrHdD
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 *  - canvasIds and actionIds are 1 indexed, not 0 indexed. This is because a 0 index signifies that
 *  a layer is not locked, and an actionId of 0 signifies that the action has not happened yet.
