 * @title Access Control List Extension
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable specific
 *      functions (public functions) of the smart contract for everyone.
 * @notice User roles are designed to restrict access to specific
 *      functions (restricted functions) of the smart contract to some users.
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission set.
 *
 * @dev OpenZeppelin AccessControl based implementation. Features are stored as
 *      "self"-roles: feature is a role assigned to the smart contract itself
 *
 * @dev Automatically assigns the deployer an admin permission
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
