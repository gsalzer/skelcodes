 * @notice A space to have an on-chain record mapping token IDs for OLD_MCRW to their original "rescue order" IDs
 * @dev This contract exists because there is no MoonCat ID => Rescue ID function
 * on the original MoonCatRescue contract. The only way to tell a given MoonCat's
 * rescue order if you don't know it is to iterate through the whole `rescueOrder`
 * array. Looping through that whole array in a smart contract would be
 * prohibitively high gas-usage, and so this alternative is needed.
