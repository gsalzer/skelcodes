 *
 * This is an ERC-20 smart contract for the GCAC token that will be used as one side
 * of a Uniswap liquidity pool trading pair. This GCAC token has the following properties:
 *
 * 1. The number of GCAC tokens from this contract that will be initially added to the 
 *    Uniswap liquidity pool shall be 100,000. The amount of WETH added to the other side of
 *    the initial Uniswap liquidity pool shall be 5.
 * 2. GCAC hereby commits to swap an amount of WETH currency with the Uniswap GCAC<>WETH 
 *    trading pair every 3 months for no fewer than 8 quarters, i.e., 2 years, commencing 
 *    for the quarterly report as filed by GCAC for the quarter ending 31-March-2021.
 * 3. The value of the WETH currency swapped by GCAC shall be equal to 1% of GCAC's official
 *    'revenue', as disclosed in each of its quarterly regulatory filings. Each WETH
 *    swap shall be performed no later than 10 working days after the regulatory filing is
 *    available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). SEDAR 
 *    is a mandatory document filing system for Canadian public companies.
 * 4. GCAC tokens returned by Uniswap from the quarterly swap of WETH shall be burned 
 *    by this smart contract, thereby reducing GCAC token circulating supply over time.
 * 5. This contract shall not be allowed mint any new GCAC tokens, i.e., no dilution.
 * 6. GCAC, the company, shall initially hold 100,000 GCAC tokens on its corporate
 *    balance sheet, i.e., the GCAC treasury tokens.
 * 7. GCAC's treasury tokens may only ever be swapped for WETH in Uniswap and are prevented
 *    from being transferred out of this contract to another exchange or wallet, i.e., no rug-pull.
 * 8. GCAC hereby commits to notify the DeFi community of its intent to withdraw liquidity from 
 *    Uniswap at least 3 months in advance. This contact enforces the liquidity-time-lock.
 * 9. GCAC hereby commits to notify the DeFi community of its intent to swap GCAC treasury tokens 
 *    on Uniswap at least 3 months in advance. This contact enforces the treasury-time-lock.

 * ABBEY DEFI
 * ========== 
 * 1. Decentralized Finance 'DeFi' is designed to be globally inclusive. 
 * 2. Centralized finance is based around national stock markets that have high barriers to entry. 
 * 3. The Abbey DeFi methodology offers companies listed on national stock exchanges exposure to DeFi.
 *
 * Abbey is a Uniswap-based DeFi service provider that allows public companies to offer people a novel 
 * way to speculate on the success of their business in a decentralized manner.
 * 
 * The premise is both elegant and simple, the public company commits to a marketing spend equal to 1% 
 * of its quarterly sales revenue. And, since it’s a public company, the exact value of this 1% is 
 * published in their public accounts, as filed quarterly with a national securities regulator.
 * 
 * Using Abbey as a Uniswap DeFi marketing agency, the public company spends 1% of its quarterly cash 
 * sales revenue on one side of a bespoke Uniswap trading contract. The other side of the Uniswap trade 
 * is the public company’s proprietary token that’s representing 1% of its future sales revenue.
 * 
 * DeFi traders wishing to speculate on the revenue growth of the public company deposit crypto-USD 
 * in return for “PUBCO-1%” Uniswap tokens. The Uniswap Automated Market Maker ensures DeFi market 
 * liquidity and legitimate price discovery. The more USD that the company deposits over time, the 
 * higher the value of the PUBCO-1% token, as held by DeFi speculators.
