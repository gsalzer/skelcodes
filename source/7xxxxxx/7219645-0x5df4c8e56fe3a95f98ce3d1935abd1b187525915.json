This is basically a CREATE2 proxy contract which implements one extra guard for CREATE2: \r\n    If a contract has been deployed at an address in the past, the DeploySafe() transaction will throw \r\n    On top of this, the seed is hashed together with msg.sender (so seed is keccak256(msg.sender, seed)) to prevent users \r\n    deploying the same contract using an obvious seed (e.g. 0x0) run into a revert \r\n    DeploySafe only throws AFTER creation. This is to save some gas - if it tries to figure out if the target address is deployed \r\n    before it actually CREATE2's then it has to do an extra SHA3 on the init code.
