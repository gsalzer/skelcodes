/*
Symbolic Restoration.

- On deploy, creates new canvas (ERC721) + New Steward.
- On deploy, takes snapshot of damanged v1.
- New Steward is blocked from transferral unless damaged v1 has been joined into the new canvas.
- To Restore():
    - New TAIAOS can only be bought if Restoration contract is the owner of old v1.
    - Thus: Buys old v1 at snapshot price and blocks it from being sold with the Restoration contract (effectively forever).
    - Snapshot owner then buys restored v1 with a deposit of 0.5 eth.
    - The restoration contract thus irrevocably binds the old artwork into the new one, effectively restoring an artwork that's always on sale.
