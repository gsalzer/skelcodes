 * @title Admin
 * @author Paul Razvan Berg
 * @notice Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is
 * an account (an admin) that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
 *
 * By default, the admin account will be the one that deploys the contract. This can later
 * be changed with {transferAdmin}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier `onlyAdmin`,
 * which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the admin.
