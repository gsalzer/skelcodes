 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

 *
 * @dev Contract which gives subclass contracts the ability to act as a pool of funds for allocating

 *   vested tokens are prevented.
 *
 *   Two types of toke grants are supported:
 *   - Irrevocable grants, intended for use in cases when vesting tokens have been issued in exchange
 *     for value, such as with tokens that have been purchased in an ICO.
 *   - Revocable grants, intended for use in cases when vesting tokens have been gifted to the holder,
