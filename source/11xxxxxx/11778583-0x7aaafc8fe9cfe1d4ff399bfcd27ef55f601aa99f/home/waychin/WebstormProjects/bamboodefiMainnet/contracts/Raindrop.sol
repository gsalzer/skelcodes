// Raindrop is the contract in charge of the lottery system.
// Every 10 days the contract will choose a winner.
// Randomness used here is based on future block hash, requiring two calls to determine the winner. (Commit + Draw).
// We are aware of the security vulnerabilities for this PRNG approach, still is for now the choice for finding the winner, because it is easier for end users.
// The PRNG method here is based on the Breeding Contract from the CriptoKitties DAPP.
