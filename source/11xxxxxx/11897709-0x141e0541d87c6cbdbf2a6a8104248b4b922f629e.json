Alpha Finance\r\nLab will get the proposed change audited and pay for the auditing cost.\r\n\r\nALPHA token collateral\r\n$50M ALPHA tokens will be put in escrow contract with 7 days timelock. ALPHA tokens will be released back to \r\nAlpha Finance Lab periodically and proportionally as the funds in discussion are paid back. Terms of the escro\r\nwill be added as an Appendix A.\r\n\r\nMechanics\r\n\r\nCREAM V2 will use 1,000 ETH sent by the attacker to CREAM V2 deployer to paydown the funds in discussion by\r\nsending the 1,000 ETH to the CREAM Multisig.\r\n\r\nAlpha Homora V2 will use 1,000 ETH sent by the attacker to Alpha Homora V2 deployer to paydown the funds in\r\ndiscussion by sending the 1,000 ETH to the CREAM Multisig.\r\n\r\nAlpha Homora V2 will repay the remaining funds in discussion by using 20% of Alpha Homora V1 and V2 reserves to\r\npaydown the funds until the funds in discussion above are repaid back. The percentages of the reserves to pay down\r\nthe debt may vary (higher or lower than 20%), and both the Alpha and CREAM team will agree to any new rates\r\nbeforehand new rates are applied. Alpha Homora V2 and CREAM V2 will agree upon the detailed technical\r\nmechanics, which will be added as an Appendix B.\r\n\r\nTimeline\r\n\r\nThere is no set timeline on when the funds in discussion have to be repaid back. The mechanics above will continue\r\nuntil the funds are repaid.\r\n\r\nAdditional\r\n\r\nIf the funds can be retrieved and repaid back to CREAM V2 from the exploiter, the mechanics described will end.\r\n\r\nAlpha Finance Lab\r\nC.R.E.A.M.
