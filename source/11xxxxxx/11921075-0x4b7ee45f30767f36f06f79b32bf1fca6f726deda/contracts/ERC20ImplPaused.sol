/** @title  ERC20 compliant token intermediary contract holding core logic.
  *
  * @notice  This contract serves as an intermediary between the exposed ERC20
  * interface in ERC20Proxy and the store of balances in ERC20Store. This
  * contract contains core logic that the proxy can delegate to
  * and that the store is called by.
  *
  * @dev  This version of ERC20Impl is intended to revert all ERC20 functions
  * that are state mutating; only view functions remain operational. Upgrading
  * to this contract places the system into a read-only paused state.
