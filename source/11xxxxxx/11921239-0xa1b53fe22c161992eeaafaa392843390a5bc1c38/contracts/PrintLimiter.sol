/** @title  A contact to govern hybrid control over increases to the token supply.
  *
  * @notice  A contract that acts as a custodian of the active token
  * implementation, and an intermediary between it and the ‘true’ custodian.
  * It preserves the functionality of direct custodianship as well as granting
  * limited control of token supply increases to an additional key.
  *
  * @dev  This contract is a layer of indirection between an instance of
  * ERC20Impl and a custodian. The functionality of the custodianship over
  * the token implementation is preserved (printing and custodian changes),
  * but this contract adds the ability for an additional key
  * (the 'limited printer') to increase the token supply up to a ceiling,
  * and this supply ceiling can only be raised by the custodian.
