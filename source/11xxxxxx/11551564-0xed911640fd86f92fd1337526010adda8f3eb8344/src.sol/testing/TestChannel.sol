/// @notice This contract will help test the `ChannelMastercopy` contract and

///         contain aliases to internal functions that should be unit-tested,
///         like the `makeExitable` call on `CMCAsset.sol`. Using this
///         contract will help reduce the amount of boilerplate needed to test
///         component functionality. For example, `CMCAsset.sol` is only
///         able to be tested via the adjudicator in many practical cases.
///         Creating a helper function allows for easier testing of only
///         that functionality.
