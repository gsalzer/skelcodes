It just checks the numbers passed in by the user and reverts if needs be.\r\n    This techique is called invariant checking and offloads maximum calculation to clients while guaranteeing no cheating is possible.\r\n    In Behodler 1 some operations were duplicated. For instance, a swap was a scarcity purchase followed by a scarcity sale. Instead, cutting out\r\n    the middle scarcity allows the factor scaling to be dropped altogether.\r\n\r\n    By bringing Scarcity, Janus, Kharon and Behodler together in one contract, Behodler 2 avoids the EXT_CALL gas fees and can take gas saving shortcuts with Scarcity\r\n    transfers. The drawback to this approach is less flexibility with fees in the way that Kharon allowed.\r\n\r\n    Behodler 2 now has Flashloan support. Instead of charging a liquidity growing fee, Behodler 2 requires the user fulfil some requirement\r\n    such as holding an NFT or staking Scarcity. This allows for zero fee flash loans that are front runner resistant and\r\n    allows a secondary flashloan market to evolve.\r\n */\r\ncontract Behodler is Scarcity {\r\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\r\n    using ABDK for int128;\r\n    using ABDK for uint256;\r\n    using AddressBalanceCheck for address;\r\n\r\n    event LiquidityAdded(\r\n        address sender,\r\n        address token,\r\n        uint256 tokenValue,\r\n        uint256 scx\r\n    );\r\n    event LiquidityWithdrawn(\r\n        address recipient,\r\n        address token,\r\n        uint256 tokenValue,\r\n        uint256 scx\r\n    );\r\n    event Swap(\r\n        address sender,\r\n        address inputToken,\r\n        address outputToken,\r\n        uint256 inputValue,\r\n        uint256 outputValue\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    struct WeidaiTokens {\r\n        address dai;\r\n        address reserve;\r\n        address weiDai;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    struct PrecisionFactors {\r\n        uint8 swapPrecisionFactor;\r\n        uint8 maxLiquidityExit; //percentage as number between 1 and 100\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    WeidaiTokens WD;\r\n    PrecisionFactors safetyParameters;\r\n    address public Weth;\r\n    address public Lachesis;\r\n    address pyroTokenLiquidityReceiver;\r\n    FlashLoanArbiter public arbiter;\r\n    address private inputSender;\r\n    bool[3] unlocked;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        safetyParameters.swapPrecisionFactor = 30; //approximately a billion\r\n        safetyParameters.maxLiquidityExit = 90;\r\n        for (uint8 i = 0; i < 3; i++) unlocked[i] = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function setSafetParameters(\r\n        uint8 swapPrecisionFactor,\r\n        uint8 maxLiquidityExit\r\n    ) external onlyOwner {\r\n        safetyParameters.swapPrecisionFactor = swapPrecisionFactor;\r\n        safetyParameters.maxLiquidityExit = maxLiquidityExit;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function getMaxLiquidityExit() public view returns (uint8) {\r\n        return safetyParameters.maxLiquidityExit;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function seed(\r\n        address weth,\r\n        address lachesis,\r\n        address flashLoanArbiter,\r\n        address _pyroTokenLiquidityReceiver,\r\n        address weidaiReserve,\r\n        address dai,\r\n        address weiDai\r\n    ) external onlyOwner {\r\n        Weth = weth;\r\n        Lachesis = lachesis;\r\n        arbiter = FlashLoanArbiter(flashLoanArbiter);\r\n        pyroTokenLiquidityReceiver = _pyroTokenLiquidityReceiver;\r\n        WD.reserve = weidaiReserve;\r\n        WD.dai = dai;\r\n        WD.weiDai = weiDai;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //Logarithmic growth can get quite flat beyond the first chunk.
