/**
 * @title Compensation Claims
 * @author Origin Protocol Inc
 * @dev Airdrop for ERC20 tokens.
 *
 *   Provides a coin airdrop with a verification period in which everyone
 *   can check that all claims are correct before any actual funds are moved
 *   to the contract.
 *
 *      - Users can claim funds during the claim period.
 *
 *      - The adjuster can set the amount of each user's claim,
 *         but only when unlocked, and not during the claim period.
 *
 *      - The governor can unlock and lock the adjuster, outside the claim period.
 *      - The governor can start the claim period, if it's not started.
 *      - The governor can collect any remaining funds after the claim period is over.
 *
 *  Intended use sequence:
 *
 *   1. Governor unlocks the adjuster
 *   2. Adjuster uploads claims
 *   3. Governor locks the adjuster
 *   4. Everyone verifies that the claim amounts and totals are correct
 *   5. Payout funds are moved to the contract
 *   6. The claim period starts
 *   7. Users claim funds
 *   8. The claim period ends
 *   9. Governor can collect any remaing funds
