Each transaction \r\nincurs a 4% tax that is distributed in four equal parts: 1% to holders, 1% burned to The Rabbit's Hole, \r\n1% locked liquidity, and 1% as a bonus to liquidity providers. As volume increases, the amount burned \r\nincreases logarithmically, eventually leading to an exponential decrease in supply.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbit Hole burns do not stop, the instant holder rewards do not stop, the 2x rewards for liquidity \r\nproviders do not stop, and the locked liquidity adds do not stop. This means the Rocket Bunny supply will \r\nbecome more scarce, your holdings will continue to increase, particularly if you are a liquidty provider \r\nearning 2x rewards, and the price floor for Rocket Bunny will continue to rise.\r\n\r\n- Deflationary supply\r\n- Rewards directly into your wallet\r\n- 2x rewards for LP\r\n- Automatic & locked liquidity adds\r\n- Whale dump protection\r\n\r\nweb: rocketbunny.io\r\ntg: @RocketBunnyChat\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\r\n\r\npragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.8.0;\r\n\r\ncontract TheRabbitsHole {\r\n\r\n    function whereTokens() public pure returns (string memory){\r\n        return \"YA TOKENS AIN'T STOLE, THEY'S IN THE RABBIT'S HOLE\";\r\n    }\r\n}","ABI":"[{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"whereTokens\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"string\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"string\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"pure\",\"type\":\"function\"}]","ContractName":"TheRabbitsHole","CompilerVersion":"v0.7.6+commit.7338295f","OptimizationUsed":"0","Runs":"200","ConstructorArguments":"","EVMVersion":"Default","Library":"","LicenseType":"MIT","Proxy":"0","Implementation":"","SwarmSource":"ipfs://085b7acfeddcc8aeefa91e3c5edc7ed98296ff767f895a3dcfc227138ba097a5"}]}
