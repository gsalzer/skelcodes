 * @dev These tokens are based on the ERC20 standard and the open-zeppelin library.
 *
 * This is an ERC-20 token representing shares of CompanyName AG that are bound to
 * a shareholder agreement that can be found at the URL defined in the constant 'terms'
 * of the 'DraggableCompanyNameShares' contract. The agreement is partially enforced
 * through the Swiss legal system, and partially enforced through this smart contract.
 * In particular, this smart contract implements a drag-along clause which allows the
 * majority of token holders to force the minority sell their shares along with them in
 * case of an acquisition. That's why the tokens are called "Draggable CompanyName AG Shares."
