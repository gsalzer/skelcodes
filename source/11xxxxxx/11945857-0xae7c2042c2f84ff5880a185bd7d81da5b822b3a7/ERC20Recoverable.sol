/**
 * @title Recoverable
 * In case of tokens that represent real-world assets such as shares of a company, one needs a way
 * to handle lost private keys. With physical certificates, courts can declare share certificates as
 * invalid so the company can issue replacements. Here, we want a solution that does not depend on
 * third parties to resolve such cases. Instead, when someone has lost a private key, he can use the
 * declareLost function to post a deposit and claim that the shares assigned to a specific address are
 * lost. To prevent front running, a commit reveal scheme is used. If he actually is the owner of the shares,
 * he needs to wait for a certain period and can then reclaim the lost shares as well as the deposit.
 * If he is an attacker trying to claim shares belonging to someone else, he risks losing the deposit
 * as it can be claimed at anytime by the rightful owner.
 * Furthermore, if "getClaimDeleter" is defined in the subclass, the returned address is allowed to
 * delete claims, returning the collateral. This can help to prevent obvious cases of abuse of the claim
 * function.

    * 1) The claim period expires and the claimant can get the deposit and the shares back by calling recover
    * 2) The "lost" private key is used at any time to call clearClaim. In that case, the claim is deleted and
    *    the deposit sent to the shareholder (the owner of the private key). It is recommended to call recover
    *    whenever someone transfers funds to let claims be resolved automatically when the "lost" private key is
    *    used again.
    * 3) The owner deletes the claim and assigns the deposit to the claimant. This is intended to be used to resolve
    *    disputes. Generally, using this function implies that you have to trust the issuer of the tokens to handle
    *    the situation well. As a rule of thumb, the contract owner should assume the owner of the lost address to be the
    *    rightful owner of the deposit.

    * whenever a claim is made for their address (this of course is only possible if they are known to the owner, e.g.
    * through a shareholder register).
