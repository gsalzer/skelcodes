 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 * 
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}.
 * 
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
