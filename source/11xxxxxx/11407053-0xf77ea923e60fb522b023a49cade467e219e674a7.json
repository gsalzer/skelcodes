Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\r\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\r\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\r\n * \r\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\r\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {UpgradeableProxy-constructor}.\r\n * \r\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\r\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\r\n */\r\nabstract contract Initializable {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\r\n     */\r\n    bool private _initialized;\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\r\n     */\r\n    bool private _initializing;\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.\r\n     */\r\n    modifier initializer() {\r\n        require(_initializing || _isConstructor() || !_initialized, \"Initializable: contract is already initialized\");\r\n        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;\r\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\r\n            _initializing = true;\r\n            _initialized = true;\r\n        }\r\n        _;\r\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\r\n            _initializing = false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    /// @dev Returns true if and only if the function is running in the constructor\r\n    function _isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {\r\n        // extcodesize checks the size of the code stored in an address, and\r\n        // address returns the current address.
