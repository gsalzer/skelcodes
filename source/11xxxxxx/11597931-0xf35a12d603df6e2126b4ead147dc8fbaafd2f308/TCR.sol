 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

        Tracer DAO Participation Agreement
                (the "Agreement")
                December 2020
BACKGROUND
1.	The Tracer DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer ("Tracer"), an open source, blockchain-based financial protocol.
2.	The Tracer DAO relies on an experimental Smart Contract framework to manage a decentralised autonomous organisations where no one party is in control. 
3.	The technical development of the Tracer DAO and Tracer will be achieved via a Governance Mechanism (defined further below) and managed via a Governance Token.
4.	Governance Tokens may be acquired during the Governance Period only by persons with sufficient technical and legal expertise to contribute their industry knowledge to the further development of the trading protocol, and who do not act as Consumers.  It is only intended for users of blockchain technology and smart contract based software systems and only intended to be provided to individuals or entities that intend to actively participate in the Tracer DAO experiments.
5.	Governance Tokens allow holders to participate in the Tracer System via its Governance Mechanism and have no ownership or economic rights of any kind.   By accepting this Agreement, you are agreeing that Tracer DAO’s Governance Tokens are not being viewed by you as an investment or a speculative asset.
