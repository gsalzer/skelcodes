/**
  The StarkEx contract tracks the state of the off-chain exchange service by storing Merkle roots
  of the vault state (off-chain account state) and the order state (including fully executed and
  partially fulfilled orders).

  The :sol:mod:`Operator` is the only entity entitled to submit state updates for a batch of
  exchange transactions by calling :sol:func:`updateState` and this is only allowed if the contract
  is not in the `frozen` state (see :sol:mod:`FullWithdrawals`). The call includes the `publicInput`
  of a STARK proof, and additional data (`applicationData`) that includes information not attested
  to by the proof.

  The `publicInput` includes the current (initial) and next (final) Merkle roots as mentioned above,
  the heights of the Merkle trees, a list of vault operations and a list of conditional transfers.

  A vault operation can be a ramping operation (deposit/withdrawal) or an indication to clear
  a full withdrawal request. Each vault operation is encoded in 3 words as follows:
  | 1. Word 0: Stark Key of the vault owner (or the requestor Stark Key for false full
  |    withdrawal).
  | 2. Word 1: Asset ID of the vault representing either the currency (for fungible tokens) or
  |    a unique token ID and its on-chain contract association (for non-fungible tokens).
  | 3. Word 2:
  |    a. ID of the vault (off-chain account)
  |    b. Vault balance change in biased representation (excess-2**63).
  |       A negative balance change implies a withdrawal while a positive amount implies a deposit.
  |       A zero balance change may be used for operations implying neither
  |       (e.g. a false full withdrawal request).
  |    c. A bit indicating whether the operation requires clearing a full withdrawal request.

  The above information is used by the exchange contract in order to update the pending accounts
  used for deposits (see :sol:mod:`Deposits`) and withdrawals (see :sol:mod:`Withdrawals`).

  The next section in the publicInput is a list of encoded conditions corresponding to the
  conditional transfers in the batch. A condition is encoded as a hash of the conditional transfer
  `applicationData`, described below, masked to 250 bits.

  The `applicationData` holds the following information:
  | 1. The ID of the current batch for which the operator is submitting the update. 
  | 2. The expected ID of the last batch accepted on chain. This allows the operator submitting
  |    state updates to ensure the same batch order is accepted on-chain as was intended by the
  |    operator in the event that more than one valid update may have been generated based on
  |    different previous batches - an unlikely but possible event.
  | 3. For each conditional transfer in the batch two words are provided:
  |    a. Word 0: The address of a fact registry contract
  |    b. Word 1: A fact to be verified on the above contract attesting that the
  |       condition has been met on-chain.

  The STARK proof attesting to the validity of the state update is submitted separately by the
  exchange service to (one or more) STARK integrity verifier contract(s).
  Likewise, the signatures of committee members attesting to
  the availability of the vault and order data is submitted separately by the exchange service to
  (one or more) availability verifier contract(s) (see :sol:mod:`Committee`).

  The state update is only accepted by the exchange contract if the integrity verifier and
  availability verifier contracts have indeed received such proof of soundness and data
  availability.
