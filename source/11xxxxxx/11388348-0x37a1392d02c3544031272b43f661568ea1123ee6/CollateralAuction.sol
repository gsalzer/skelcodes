/**
* @dev Library to perform safe calls to standard method for ERC20 tokens.
*
* Why Transfers: transfer methods could have a return value (bool), throw or revert for insufficient funds or
* unathorized value.
*
* Why Approve: approve method could has a return value (bool) or does not accept 0 as a valid value (BNB token).
* The common strategy used to clean approvals.
*
* We use the Solidity call instead of interface methods because in the case of transfer, it will fail
* for tokens with an implementation without returning a value.
* Since versions of Solidity 0.4.22 the EVM has a new opcode, called RETURNDATASIZE.
* This opcode stores the size of the returned data of an external call. The code checks the size of the return value
* after an external call and reverts the transaction in case the return data is shorter than expected
