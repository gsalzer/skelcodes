 *      Welcome to the temporary ?????????? ????????? ????????. 
 *      It's currently a place-holder whose only functionality is 
 *      forward-compatability with the soon-to-be-deployed actual 
 *      contract. 
 *
 *      Its job is to accrue funds generated by ?????????? to pay out 
 *      as ????????? to the ??? token holders. But that's only the 
 *      start. ??? token holders will form a ??? who own and run 
 *      ??????????, and will be able to vote of the future of the 
 *      platform via this very contract! They'll also get to say where 
 *      ????????? - Etheraffle's charitable arm - funds go to as well. 
 *      All whilst earning a ???????? from ticket sales of ??????????! 
 *
 *
 *                     ???????? ????? - ???? ?????!
