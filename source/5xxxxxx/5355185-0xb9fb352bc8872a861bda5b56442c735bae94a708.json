This platform is a cohesive and self sustaining society, economy and a governance framework bound by universal moral principles. Our technology and principles have the potential to bring about enormous positive change in our world and correct many of its existing flaws.\r\n\r\nPurpose of this Initial Coin Offering\r\n\r\nThe funds raised from this ICO is to be utilized for the furtherance of the goals and objectives of our movement as detailed in our program white paper. SVT Tokens are granted to you purely as a reward for contributing to our cause and also to encourage you to be an active participant in the Noble Society, Economy and Government. \r\n\r\nWhat Sovereign Tokens (SVT) and Sovereigns (SOV) ARE and ARE NOT\r\n\r\nOwnership of Sovereign tokens or the Sovereign currency implies that the holder is a member of the Noble Nation’s society and has all rights and privileges to operate within the Noble Nation platform in accordance with the constitution of the Noble Nation, including:\r\n1. Participation in the noble society and the merit framework;\r\n2. Participation and trade in the noble economy;\r\n3. Participation in the direct democracy;\r\n4. Participation in all other frameworks of Noble Nation as may be applicable.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Sovereign tokens or currency and/or the participation in any of the above activities implies that the individual has pledged to abide and uphold the principles and the constitution of Noble Nation.\r\n\r\nOwnership of Sovereign tokens or the Sovereign currency DOES NOT in any way grant the holder any:\r\n1. Ownership interest in any legal entity;\r\n2. Equity interest;\r\n3. Share of profits and/or losses, or assets and/or liabilities;\r\n4. Status as a creditor or lender;\r\n5. Claim in bankruptcy as equity interest holder or creditor;\r\n6. Repayment/refund obligation from the system or the legal entity issuer.\r\n\r\nThe Inherent Risks of the Noble Nation Project\r\n\r\nWhile the founding members have committed their lives to the cause of Noble Nation and they will endeavor to the best of their human ability to fulfill this vision, it is not possible to make any guarantee as to the final outcome of our vision and goals.\r\n\r\nWe do not make any guarantees or representations as to the Token’s/Sovereign’s tradeability, reliability or fitness for a financial transaction – these are all dependent on market conditions within and outside the Noble Nation and the technical maturity of the platform.\r\n\r\nIn summary, your primary motivation for participating in this ICO should be to support the vision and mission of Noble Nation and to participate in the Noble Economy, Society and Government.\r\n\r\nNationals from all Countries are Welcome to Participate in the Noble Nation ICO\r\n\r\nHowever, you should not participate in this ICO if you live in a country where basic political and economic expression is suppressed and the acquisition of these tokens may violate any laws or regulations you are subject to.\r\n\r\nWe do not screen participants by nationality as we cannot practically be expected to keep track of regulations in over 200 national jurisdictions across the the world.\r\n\r\nNoble Nation Network is engaged in Social, Political and Economic action in conformance with the political and economic rights guaranteed by the universal declaration of human rights while adhering to very high standards of ethics, morality and natural justice. But you are responsible for making sure that you are in conformance with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nConverting Sovereign Tokens (SVT) to Sovereigns in the Noble Economy\r\n\r\nWhen the beta Noble Nation platform is functional, SVT token holders will be provided instructions on creating an Identity in the Noble Nation, and how to convert SVT tokens into Sovereigns. All trade within the Noble Nation platform will utilize the currency of the Noble Economy, the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nTo create an identity on the Noble Nation platform, the token holder must agree to honor and uphold the principles of Noble Nation. Each human individual may hold only a single Identity in the Noble Nation. At this stage, they will be required to provide identity details conforming to generally accepted KYC/AML requirements. Unlike other platforms though these details will be cryptographically protected by the privacy framework backed by the 3rd root law of the Noble Nation. \r\n\r\nBy contributing to this ICO, all participants confirm that:\r\n\r\n1. You are 18 years or above at the date of contribution.\r\n2. You are not under any restrictions to use the website and participate in this ICO.\r\n3. You have never been engaged in any illegal activity including but not limited to money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other activity deemed illegal by applicable law.\r\n4. You further confirm that you will not be using this website, SVT Tokens or any other system or aspect of Noble Nation for any illegal activity whatsoever.\r\n5. You are the absolute owner of the ethereum address and/or the crypto currency wallet used to contribute to this ICO and have full control over the same.\r\n6. The address provided is a ERC-20 wallet (not an “exchange” wallet).\r\n\r\nApart from the above, all participants are bound by the general Terms of Service (https://www.noblenation.net/tos) & Privacy Policy (https://www.noblenation.net/privacy-policy) of the Noble Nation Network.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* This file is a flattened version of OpenZeppelin (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin) \r\n * SafeMath.sol
