Use at your own risk.\r\n//\r\n// BUYERS: to protect against scams:\r\n// 1) check the price by clicking on \"Read smart contract\" in etherscan. Two prices are published\r\n//     a) price for 1 AOC in wei (1 wei = 10^-18 ETH), and b) number of AOC you get for 1 ETH\r\n// 2) Make sure you use high enough gas price that your TX confirms within 1 hour, to avoid the scam\r\n//    detailed below*\r\n// 3) Check the hardcoded AOC address below givet to AOCToken() constructor. Make sure this is the real AOC\r\n//    token. Scammers could clone this contract and modify the address to sell you fake tokens.\r\n//\r\n\r\n// This contract enables trustless exchange of AOC tokens for ETH.\r\n// Anyone can use this contract to sell AOC, as long as it is in an empty state.\r\n// Contract is in an empty state if it has no AOC or ETH in it and is not in cooldown\r\n// The main idea behind the contract is to keep it very simple to use, especially for buyers.\r\n// Sellers need to set allowance and call the setup() function using MEW, which is a little more involved.\r\n// Buyers can use Metamask to send and receive AOC tokens.\r\n//\r\n// To use the contract:\r\n// 1) Call approve on the AOC ERC20 address for this contract. That will allow the contract\r\n//    to hold your AOC tokens in escrow. You can always withdraw you AOC tokens back.\r\n//    You can make this call using MEW. The AOC contract address and ABI are available here:\r\n//    https://etherscan.io/address/0x73d7b530d181ef957525c6fbe2ab8f28bf4f81cf#code\r\n// 2) Call setup(AOC_amount, price) on this contract, for example by using MEW.\r\n//    This call will take your tokens and hold them in escrow, while at the same time\r\n//    you get the ownership of the contract. While you own the contract (i.e. while the contract\r\n//    holds your tokens or your ETH, nobody else can call setup(). If they do, the call will fail.\r\n//    If you call approve() on the AOC contract, but someone else calls setup() on this contract\r\n//    nothing bad happens. You can either wait for this contract to go into empty state, or find\r\n//    another contract (or publish your own). You will need to call approve() again for the new contract.\r\n// 3) Advertise the contract address so others can buy AOC from it. Buying AOC is simple, the\r\n//    buyer needs to send ETH to the contract address, and the contract sends them AOC. The buyer\r\n//    can verify the price by viewing the contract.\r\n// 4) To claim your funds back (both AOC and ETH resulting from any sales), simply send 0 ETH to\r\n//    the contract. The contract will send you ETH and AOC back, and reset the contract for others to use.\r\n//\r\n// *) There is a cooldown period of 1 hour after the contract is reset, before it can be used again.\r\n//    This is to avoid possible scams where the seller sees a pending TX on the contract, then resets\r\n//    the contract and call setup() is a much higher price. If the seller does that with very high gas price,\r\n//    they could change the price for the buyer's pending TX. A cooldown of 1 hour prevents this attac, as long\r\n//    as the buyer's TX confirms within the hour.\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface AOCToken {\r\n    function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256);\r\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\r\n    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);\r\n    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract AOCTrader {\r\n    AOCToken AOC = AOCToken(0x73d7B530d181ef957525c6FBE2Ab8F28Bf4f81Cf); // hardcoded AOC address to avoid scams.\r\n    address public seller;\r\n    uint256 public price; // price is in wei, not ether\r\n    uint256 public AOC_available; // remaining amount of AOC.
