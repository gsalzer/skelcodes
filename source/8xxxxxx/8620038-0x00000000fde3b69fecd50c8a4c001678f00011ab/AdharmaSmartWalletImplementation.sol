 * @notice The Adharma Smart Wallet is an emergency smart wallet implementation
 * that can be immediately upgraded to by the Upgrade Beacon Controller Manager
 * in the event of a critical-severity exploit, or after a 90-day period of
 * inactivity by Dharma. It gives the user direct, sole custody and control over
 * their smart wallet until the Upgrade Beacon Controller Manager issues another
 * upgrade to the implementation contract. Note that meta-transactions are not
 * supported on this implementation - calls must originate from the account
 * itself.
