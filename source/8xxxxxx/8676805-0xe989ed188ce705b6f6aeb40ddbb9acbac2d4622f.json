A private matter is something one doesn't\r\nwant the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one\r\ndoesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively\r\nreveal oneself to the world.  \r\n\r\nIf two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of\r\ntheir interaction.  Each party can speak about their own memory of\r\nthis; how could anyone prevent it?  One could pass laws against it,\r\nbut the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to\r\nan open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.  If many\r\nparties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the\r\nothers and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other\r\nparties.  The power of electronic communications has enabled such\r\ngroup speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it\r\nto.\r\n\r\nSince we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a\r\ntransaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary\r\nfor that transaction.  Since any information can be spoken of, we\r\nmust ensure that we reveal as little as possible.  In most cases\r\npersonal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a\r\nstore and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. \r\nWhen I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages,\r\nmy provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying\r\nor what others are saying to me;  my provider only need know how to\r\nget the message there and how much I owe them in fees.  When my\r\nidentity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction,\r\nI have no privacy.  I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must\r\n_always_ reveal myself.\r\n\r\nTherefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction\r\nsystems.  Until now, cash has been the primary such system.  An\r\nanonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.  An\r\nanonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when\r\ndesired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.\r\n\r\nPrivacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  If I say\r\nsomething, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.  If \r\nthe content of my speech is available to the world, I have no\r\nprivacy.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to\r\nencrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for\r\nprivacy.  Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when\r\nthe default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.\r\n\r\nWe cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless\r\norganizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.  It is to\r\ntheir advantage to speak of us, and  we should expect that they will\r\nspeak.  To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the\r\nrealities of information. Information does not just want to be free,\r\nit longs to be free.  Information expands to fill the available\r\nstorage space.  Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;\r\nInformation is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and\r\nunderstands less than Rumor.\r\n\r\nWe must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  We must\r\ncome together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions\r\nto take place.  People have been defending their own privacy for\r\ncenturies with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret\r\nhandshakes, and couriers.  The technologies of the past did not allow\r\nfor strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.\r\n\r\nWe the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We\r\nare defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail\r\nforwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nCypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software\r\nto defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,\r\nwe're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow\r\nCypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all\r\nto use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the\r\nsoftware we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that\r\na widely dispersed system can't be shut down. \r\n\r\nCypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is\r\nfundamentally a private act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes\r\ninformation from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography\r\nreach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.\r\nCryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with\r\nit the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible. \r\n\r\nFor privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.\r\nPeople must come and together deploy these systems for the common\r\ngood.  Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's\r\nfellows in society.  We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your\r\nconcerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive\r\nourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because\r\nsome may disagree with our goals.\r\n\r\nThe Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for\r\nprivacy.  Let us proceed together apace.\r\n\r\nOnward.\r\n\r\nEric Hughes\r\n<hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\r\n\r\n9 March 1993\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * @dev Provides information about the current execution context, including the\r\n * sender of the transaction and its data.
