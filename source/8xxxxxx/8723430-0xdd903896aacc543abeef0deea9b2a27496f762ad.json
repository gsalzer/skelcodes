The tournament is split into three major PHASES:\r\n///      - The first Phase is the Admission Phase. During this time, Wizards can be entered into\r\n///        the tournament with their admission fee, and will be given a power level commensurate\r\n///        with that fee. Their power level can not exceed the base power level encoded into the NFT.\r\n///        No duels take place during this phase.\r\n///      - The second Phase is the Revival Phase. During this time, new Wizards can enter the tournament,\r\n///        eliminated Wizards can be revived, and the dueling commences!\r\n///      - The third phase is the Elimination Phase. It's all duels, all the time. No new Wizards can enter,\r\n///        all eliminations are _final_. It's at this time that the Blue Mold begins to grow, forcing\r\n///        Wizards to engage in battle or be summarily eliminated.\r\n///      - Collectively the phases where Wizards can enter the tournament (i.e. Admission Phase and\r\n///        Revival Phase) are the Enter Phases.\r\n///      - Collectively the phases where Wizards can duel (i.e. Revival Phase and Elimination Phase)\r\n///        are the Battle Phases.\r\n///\r\n///  2. During the Battle Phases, where Wizards can duel, we break time up into a series of repeating WINDOWS:\r\n///      - The first Window is the Ascension Window. During the Elimination Phase, Ascension Windows are critically\r\n///        important: Any Wizard which is in danger of being eliminated by the next Blue Mold power increase\r\n///        can attempt to Ascend during this time. If multiple Wizards attempt to Ascend, they are paired\r\n///        off into Duels to Exhaustion: A one-time, winner-takes-all battle that sees one Wizard triumphant\r\n///        and the other Wizard eliminated from the tournament. If an odd number of Wizards attempt to Ascend,\r\n///        the last Wizard to attempt to Ascend remains in the Ascension Chamber where they _must_ accept the\r\n///        first duel challenge offered to them in the following Fight Window. During the Revival Phase, the time\r\n///        slice which would be an Ascension Windows is counted as more or less nothing.\r\n///      - The second Window is the Fight Window. This is where all the fun happens! Wizards challenge Wizards,\r\n///        and their duels result in power transfers. But beware! If your power level drops to zero (or below\r\n///        the Blue Mold level), you will be eliminated during the Elimination Phase!\r\n///      - The third Window is the Resolution Window. This is a period of time after the Fight Window equal\r\n///        to the maximum length of a duel. During the Resolution Window, the only action that most Wizards\r\n///        can take is to reveal moves for duels initiated during the Fight Window. However, this is also the\r\n///        time slice during which a successfully Ascending Wizard is able to power up!\r\n///      - The fourth Window is the Culling Window. During the Elimination Phase, the Culling Window is used\r\n///        to permanently remove all Wizards who have been reduced to zero power (are tired), or who have fallen below\r\n///        the power level of the inexorable Blue Mold.\r\n///\r\n///      Note that since Wizards can't ascend or be culled during Revival Phase, the Ascension and Culling windows\r\n///        during Revival Phase don't have any utility/meaning until the Revival Phase is over.\r\n///\r\n/// 3. A complete sequence of four Windows is called a SESSION. During the official Cheeze Wizard tournament,\r\n///    we will set the Session length to as close to 8 hours as possible (while still using blocks as time\r\n///    keeping mechanism), ensuring three Sessions per day.
