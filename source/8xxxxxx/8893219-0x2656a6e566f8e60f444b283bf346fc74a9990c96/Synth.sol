-----------------------------------------------------------------

A proxy contract that, if it does not recognise the function
being called on it, passes all value and call data to an

The former executes in the proxy's context, and so will preserve 
msg.sender and store data at the proxy address. The latter will not.
Therefore, any contract the proxy wraps in the CALL style must
implement the Proxyable interface, in order that it can pass msg.sender
into the underlying contract as the state parameter, messageSender.
