/*
This is the smart contract for the ERC 20 standard Tratok token.
During the development of the smart contract, active attention was paid to make the contract as simple as possible.
As the majority of functions are simple addition and subtraction of existing balances, we have been able to make the contract very lightweight.
This has the added advantage of reducing gas costs and ensuring that transaction fees remain low.
The smart contract has been made publically available, keeping with the team's philosophy of transparency.
This is an update on the second generation smart contract which can be found at 0x0cbc9b02b8628ae08688b5cc8134dc09e36c443b.
The contract has been updated to match a change in project philosophy and enhance distribution and widespread adoption of the token via free airdrops.
Further enhancements have been made for this third-generation:
A.) Enhanced anti-fraud measures.
B.) A Contingency plan to ensure that in the event of an exchange being compromised, that there is a facility to prevent the damage hurting the Tratok ecosystem.
C.) More efficient gas usage (e.g. Use of External instead of public).
