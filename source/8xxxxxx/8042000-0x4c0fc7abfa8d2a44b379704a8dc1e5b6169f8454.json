The general flow is: they both deposit a stake (they can withdraw until\\n    both stakes have been deposited), then their agreement is either fulfilled or not based on\\n    actions outside of this contract, then either party can \\\"resolve\\\" by specifying how they think\\n    funds should be split based on each party\\u0027s actions in relation to the agreement terms.\\n    Funds are automatically dispersed once there\\u0027s a resolution. If the parties disagree, they can\\n    summon a predefined arbitrator to settle their dispute.\\n\\n    @dev\\n    There are several types of AgreementManager which inherit from this contract. The inheritance\\n    tree looks like:\\n    AgreementManager\\n        AgreementManagerETH\\n            AgreementManagerETH_Simple\\n            AgreementManagerETH_ERC792\\n        AgreementManagerERC20\\n            AgreementManagerERC20_Simple\\n            AgreementManagerERC792_Simple\\n\\n    Essentially there are two options:\\n    (1) Does the agreement use exclusively ETH, or also at least one ERC20 Token?\\n    (2) Does the agreement use simple arbitration (an agreed upon external address), or ERC792\\n        (Kleros) arbitration?\\n    There are four contracts, one for each combination of options, although much of their code is\\n    shared. AgreementManagerERC20 can handle purely ETH agreements, but it\\u0027s cheaper to use\\n    AgreementManagerETH.\\n\\n    To avoid comment duplication, comments have been pushed as high in the inheritance tree as\\n    possible. Several functions are declared for the first time in AgreementManagerETH and\\n    AgreementManagerERC20 rather than in AgreementManager, because they take slightly different\\n    arguments.\\n\\n    **** NOTES ON REENTRANCY ****\\n\\n    For ease of review, functions that call untrusted external functions (even via multiple calls)\\n    and which have these external calls wrapped in a reentrancy guard will have\\n    \\\"_Untrusted_Guarded\\\" appended to the function name. Untrusted functions which don\\u0027t have their\\n    external calls wrapped in a reentrancy guard will have _Untrusted_Unguarded appended to their\\n    name. One function has \\\"_Sometimes_Untrusted_Guarded\\\" appended to its name, as it\\u0027s\\n    _Untrusted_Guarded untrusted in some inheriting functions. This naming convention does not\\n    apply to public and external functions.\\n\\n    An external function call is safe if (a) nothing after the function call depends on any\\n    contract state that can change after the call is made, and (b) no contract state will be\\n    changed after the external call. When those two conditions don\\u0027t obviously hold we use a\\n    reentrancy guard. When those two conditions do hold we safely ignore reentrancy protection.\\n    We\\u0027ll refer to calls that clearly meet both conditions as being \\\"Reentrancy Safe\\\" in other\\n    comments.\\n\\n    You can prove to yourself that our code is reentrancy safe by verifying these things:\\n    (1) Every function whose name ends with \\\"_Untrusted_Guarded\\\" has a reentrancy guard wrapped\\n    around any external calls that it contains.\\n    (2) Every function call whose name ends with \\\"_Untrusted_Unguarded\\\" is either Reentrancy Safe\\n    as described above, or it\\u0027s wrapped in a reentrancy guard.\\n    (3) The body of every function whose name ends with \\\"_Untrusted_Unguarded\\\" contains only\\n    Reentrancy Safe calls.\\n    (4) Every external function in our contracts that modifies the state of a pre-existing\\n    agreement is protected by a reentrancy check.\\n\\n    Note that a reentrancy guard looks like \\\"getThenSetPendingExternalCall(agreement, true)\\\"\\n    before the code that it\\u0027s guarding, and \\\"setPendingExternalCall(agreement, previousValue)\\\"\\n    after the code that it\\u0027s guarding.
