/**
 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.
 * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.
 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply
 * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.
 *
 * Real Token Smart Contract Features.
 *
 * - Contract owner can transfer ownership to a different ethereun address.
 * - Contract owner can mint and burn tokens to and from an address.
 * - Contract owner can set addresses in the whitelist and remove from the whitelist.
 * - 3rd Party access to set allowances for transfer by token owner only if whitelisted and timelock cleared.
 * - Whitelisted investors who can transact with other investors who are whitelisted.
 * - Token Vesting. Investor purchase date must meet one year timestamp for token owner to allow transfer token(s).
 * - If an investor is cleared from (whitelist, timelock), investor can send tokens to whitelisted investor who is not vested.
