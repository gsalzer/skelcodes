Single Point Of Failure: This experiment in less than one week highlighted that 100 ARTE for every NFT minted is the wrong incentive.\r\n * \r\n * 2. Incentives: The V1 architecture allows people to mint NFT and earn 100 $ARTE without caring to create valuable NFTs for all $ARTE Holders.\r\n * \r\n * # And Now?\r\n * \r\n * We're already working for the next big update of ethart (ethart V2), based on solving the quality issue.\r\n * \r\n * ## New Reward System for minting Co-Owned NFTs:\r\n * \r\n * Every minted NFT will remain pending for a weekly period, and if ARTE holders vote by staking a sufficient amount of Tokens, the NFT will be added to the list, and the creator will earn the Reward. This new architecture can empower the participation of ARTE holder based on a fundamental incentive to empower the quality of minted NFTs:\r\n * \r\n * If ARTE holders think that a co-owned NFT can generate value = they choose to Reward the creator (using the ethart locked funds | 0x7687fd356d1BD155e72B6eee6c2E2067F08489fB) by minting the co-owned NFT. If not, the NFT will not be minted\r\n * \r\n * ## State Holder Improvements:\r\n * \r\n * Improvements in gas fees to reduce the cost of minting Co-Owned NFTs\r\n * \r\n * ## Rewards Flexible Halving System:\r\n * \r\n * The reward after the proposal to mint a Co-Owned NFT will be halved by the amount of locked token in the ethart wallet.\r\n * \r\n * You can follow this R&D by this repo.
