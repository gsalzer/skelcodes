This is necessary so that in the event of a sharp increase in ETH, the entry fee does not become too large.\r\n\r\nThe first area is the Personal Affiliate Program. Half of your donation is allocated to it. \r\nThese funds are received by the user who is your Referrer and who invited you to the program. For FirstLine users this will be the address of the owner of the smart contract.\r\n\r\nThe second direction of the affiliate program is the Corporate affiliate program. The second half of your donation is allocated to it.\r\nIt goes to your UpLine (the person who invited the partner who invited you). You, in turn, will also receive income from the contributions\r\nof partners who register in the program at the invitation of the users whom you brought. So the more people you invite, the higher your passive income will become.\r\n\r\nEvery fourth user you invite starts reinvestment. This is an event that allows you to invite new people. This will be charged a fee equal to the original donation. But you don't pay it. Paid automatically by every fourth partner. These funds are divided in half and distributed in two areas of the affiliate program.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of the Personal Affiliate Program, half of the allocated funds go to your partner's Upline, who became the fourth on the account. This is the Upline for you, the Referrer.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the funds goes to the corporate affiliate program. According to its terms, funds for reinvestment go to the ETH address of the owner of the smart contract. \r\nWe are very grateful to all of you for your efforts. Your activity is what brings the creation and full launch of our project and platform closer.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the conditions and rules indicated in the code completely exclude fraud or the possibility of changing the conditions on our part. \r\nAll funds are automatically distributed among recipients, which makes it impossible to scam this affiliate program.\r\n\r\nYou can donate only once from one address. More, you will not have to pay for anything, under no circumstances. The smart contract is designed in such a way that you cannot send a  donation if you have already made it earlier.\r\n\r\nInvite people to the ToGETher Affiliate Program and earn money! \r\nIn order to fully offset the entry costs, you only need to bring two people. Users whom you invite later will only bring you profit!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code below is a simplified version of our Affiliate Program. We did not fill it with many incomprehensible functions,\r\nmaking it as understandable as possible even for those users who have minimal knowledge of programming. \r\nThat is why you will not see separate functions for the logic of sending and distributing funds or reinvesting here. \r\nAll these functions are already included in the conditions prescribed in the registration functions.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention!\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    contract ToGETher {\r\n        \r\n         struct User  {\r\n            uint id;\r\n            address userAddress;\r\n            address referrerAddress;\r\n            uint partnersCount;\r\n            address UpLinePartner;\r\n     }\r\n         \r\n         struct partner {\r\n             address userAddress;\r\n             address referrerAddress;\r\n             address UpLinePartner;\r\n         }\r\n         \r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\n        address public ownerWallet;  \r\n        uint private cost = 0.06 ether;\r\n        address[25000] private FirstLineUser;\r\n        uint public countFirstLineUser = 25000;\r\n    \r\n        partner[] private partners;\r\n       \r\n// This is a function that denotes the owner of a smart contract. \r\n// It is designed so that the owner also exists as a user.
