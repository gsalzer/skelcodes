 Notes on signature malleability: Ethereum took the same
 precaution as in bitcoin was used to prevent that:

 https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/crypto/signature_test.go
 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md
 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2.md

 However, ecrecover still allows ambigous signatures. Thus, recover that wraps ecrecover checks for ambigous
 signatures and only allows unique signatures.
