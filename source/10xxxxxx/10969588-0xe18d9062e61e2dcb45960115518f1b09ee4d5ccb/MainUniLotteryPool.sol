/**
 *  UniLotteryPool version v0.1
 *
 *  This is the main UniLottery Pool DAO contract, which governs all 
 *  pool and lottery operations, and holds all poolholder funds.
 *  
 *  This contract uses ULPT tokens to track users share of the pool.
 *  Currently, this contract itself is an ULPT token - gas saving is
 *  a preference, given the current huge Ethereum gas fees, so better
 *  fit more inside a single contract.
 *
 *  This contract is responsible for launching new lotteries, 
 *  managing profits, and managing user fund contributions.
 *
 *  This is because the project is in early stage, and current version
 *  is by no means finalized. Some features will be implemented
 *  or decided not to be implemented later, after testing the concept
 *  with the initial version at first.
 *
 *  This version (v0.1) allows only basic pool functionality, targeted 
 *  mostly to the only-one-poolholder model, because most likely 
 *  only Owner is going to use this pool version.
 *
 *  =================================================
 *
 *  Who can transfer money to/from the pool?
 *
 *  There are 2 actors which could initiate money transfers:
 *  1. Pool shareholders - by providing/removing liquidity in
 *      exchange for ULPT.
 *  2. Lottery contracts - on start, pool provides them initial funds,
 *      and on finish, lottery returns initial funds + profits
 *      back to the pool.
 *
 *  -------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  In which functions the money transfers occur?
 *
 *  There are 4 functions which might transfer money to/from the pool:
 *
 *  1. [IN] The lotteryFinish() function. 
 *      Used by the finished lotteries to transfer initial funds 
 *      and profits back to the pool.
 *
 *  2. [IN] provideLiquidity() function. 
 *      Is called by users to provide ETH into the pool in exchange
 *      for ULPT pool share tokens - user become pool shareholders.
 *
 *  3. [OUT] removeLiquidity() function.
 *      Is called by users when they want to remove their liquidity
 *      share from the pool. ETH gets transfered from pool to 
 *      callers wallet, and corresponding ULPT get burned.
 *
 *  4. [OUT] launchLottery() function.
 *      This function deploys a new lottery contract, and transfers
 *      its initial funds from pool balance to the newly deployed 
 *      lottery contract.
 *      Note that lotteries can't finish with negative profits, so
 *      every lottery must return its initial profits back to the
 *      pool on finishing.

        //                                                      //
        // ==================================================== //
        //
        // We know that "percentage" is ALWAYS <= 100%, because
        // msg.value is already added to address(this).balance before
        // the payable function's body executes.
        //
        // However, notice that when "percentage" approaches 100%,
        // the denominator approaches 0, and that's not good.
        //
        // So, we must ensure that uint256 precision is enough to
        // handle such situations, and assign a "default" value for
        // amountToMint if such situation occurs.
        //
        // The most prominent case when this situation occurs, is on
        // the first-ever liquidity provide, when ULPT total supply is 
        // zero, and the "percentage" value is 100%, because pool's
        // balance was 0 before the operation.
        //
        // In such situation, we mint the 100 initial ULPT, which 
        // represent the pool share of the first ever pool liquidity 
        // provider, and that's 100% of the pool.
        // 
        // Also, we do the same thing (mint 100 ULPT tokens), on all
        // on all other situations when "percentage" is too close to 100%,
        // such as when there's a very tiny amount of liquidity left in
        // the pool.
        //
        // We check for those conditions based on precision of uint256
        // number type.
        // We know, that 256-bit uint can store up to roughly 10^74
        // base-10 values.
        //
        // Also, in our formula:
        // "totalSupply" can go to max. 10^30 (in extreme cases).
        // "percentage" up to 10^12 (with more-than-enough precision).
        // 
        // When multiplied, that's still only 10^(30+12) = 10^42 ,
        // and that's still a long way to go to 10^74.
        //
        // So, the denominator "(_100PERCENT) - percentage" can go down
        // to 1 safely, we must only ensure that it's not zero - 
        // and the uint256 type will take care of all precision needed.
