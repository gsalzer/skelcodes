A slice represents a part of a string -\r\n *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no\r\n *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify\r\n *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less\r\n *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.\r\n *\r\n *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return\r\n *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for\r\n *      instance, `s.split(\".\")` will return the text up to the first '.',\r\n *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.\r\n *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you\r\n *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:\r\n *      `s.copy().split(\".\")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since\r\n *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many\r\n *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.\r\n *\r\n *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating\r\n *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in\r\n *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second\r\n *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.\r\n *\r\n *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than\r\n *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if\r\n *      required.\r\n *\r\n *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying\r\n *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,\r\n *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values\r\n *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.\r\n */\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary strings {\r\n    struct slice {\r\n        uint _len;\r\n        uint _ptr;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function memcpy(uint dest, uint src, uint len) private pure {\r\n        // Copy word-length chunks while possible\r\n        for(; len >= 32; len -= 32) {\r\n            assembly {\r\n                mstore(dest, mload(src))\r\n            }\r\n            dest += 32;\r\n            src += 32;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Copy remaining bytes\r\n        uint mask = 256 ** (32 - len) - 1;\r\n        assembly {\r\n            let srcpart := and(mload(src), not(mask))\r\n            let destpart := and(mload(dest), mask)\r\n            mstore(dest, or(destpart, srcpart))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire string.\r\n     * @param self The string to make a slice from.\r\n     * @return A newly allocated slice containing the entire string.\r\n     */\r\n    function toSlice(string memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\r\n        uint ptr;\r\n        assembly {\r\n            ptr := add(self, 0x20)\r\n        }\r\n        return slice(bytes(self).length, ptr);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * @dev Returns the length of a null-terminated bytes32 string.\r\n     * @param self The value to find the length of.\r\n     * @return The length of the string, from 0 to 32.\r\n     */\r\n    function len(bytes32 self) internal pure returns (uint) {\r\n        uint ret;\r\n        if (self == 0)\r\n            return 0;\r\n        if (self & 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff == 0) {\r\n            ret += 16;\r\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x100000000000000000000000000000000);\r\n        }\r\n        if (self & 0xffffffffffffffff == 0) {\r\n            ret += 8;\r\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x10000000000000000);\r\n        }\r\n        if (self & 0xffffffff == 0) {\r\n            ret += 4;\r\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x100000000);\r\n        }\r\n        if (self & 0xffff == 0) {\r\n            ret += 2;\r\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x10000);\r\n        }\r\n        if (self & 0xff == 0) {\r\n            ret += 1;\r\n        }\r\n        return 32 - ret;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire bytes32, interpreted as a\r\n     *      null-terminated utf-8 string.\r\n     * @param self The bytes32 value to convert to a slice.\r\n     * @return A new slice containing the value of the input argument up to the\r\n     *         first null.\r\n     */\r\n    function toSliceB32(bytes32 self) internal pure returns (slice memory ret) {\r\n        // Allocate space for `self` in memory, copy it there, and point ret at it\r\n        assembly {\r\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\r\n            mstore(0x40, add(ptr, 0x20))\r\n            mstore(ptr, self)\r\n            mstore(add(ret, 0x20), ptr)\r\n        }\r\n        ret._len = len(self);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * @dev Returns a new slice containing the same data as the current slice.\r\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\r\n     * @return A new slice containing the same data as `self`.\r\n     */\r\n    function copy(slice memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\r\n        return slice(self._len, self._ptr);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * @dev Copies a slice to a new string.\r\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\r\n     * @return A newly allocated string containing the slice's text.\r\n     */\r\n    function toString(slice memory self) internal pure returns (string memory) {\r\n        string memory ret = new string(self._len);\r\n        uint retptr;\r\n        assembly { retptr := add(ret, 32) }\r\n\r\n        memcpy(retptr, self._ptr, self._len);\r\n        return ret;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * @dev Returns the length in runes of the slice.
