As Synth users transact,\na small fee is deducted from each transaction, which collects\nin the fee pool. Fees are immediately converted to XDRs, a type\nof reserve currency similar to SDRs used by the IMF:\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR\n\nUsers are entitled to withdraw fees from periods that they participated\nin fully, e.g. they have to stake before the period starts. They\ncan withdraw fees for the last 6 periods as a single lump sum.\nCurrently fee periods are 7 days long, meaning it's assumed\nusers will withdraw their fees approximately once a month. Fees\nwhich are not withdrawn are redistributed to the whole pool,\nenabling these non-claimed fees to go back to the rest of the commmunity.\n\nFees can be withdrawn in any synth currency.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n*/\n\n\ncontract FeePool is Proxyable, SelfDestructible {\n\n    using SafeMath for uint;\n    using SafeDecimalMath for uint;\n\n    Synthetix public synthetix;\n\n    // A percentage fee charged on each transfer.\n    uint public transferFeeRate;\n\n    // Transfer fee may not exceed 10%.\n    uint constant public MAX_TRANSFER_FEE_RATE = SafeDecimalMath.unit() / 10;\n\n    // A percentage fee charged on each exchange between currencies.\n    uint public exchangeFeeRate;\n\n    // Exchange fee may not exceed 10%.\n    uint constant public MAX_EXCHANGE_FEE_RATE = SafeDecimalMath.unit() / 10;\n\n    // The address with the authority to distribute fees.\n    address public feeAuthority;\n\n    // Where fees are pooled in XDRs.\n    address public constant FEE_ADDRESS = 0xfeEFEEfeefEeFeefEEFEEfEeFeefEEFeeFEEFEeF;\n\n    // This struct represents the issuance activity that's happened in a fee period.\n    struct FeePeriod {\n        uint feePeriodId;\n        uint startingDebtIndex;\n        uint startTime;\n        uint feesToDistribute;\n        uint feesClaimed;\n    }\n\n    // The last 6 fee periods are all that you can claim from.\n    // These are stored and managed from [0], such that [0] is always\n    // the most recent fee period, and [5] is always the oldest fee\n    // period that users can claim for.\n    uint8 constant public FEE_PERIOD_LENGTH = 6;\n    FeePeriod[FEE_PERIOD_LENGTH] public recentFeePeriods;\n\n    // The next fee period will have this ID.\n    uint public nextFeePeriodId;\n\n    // How long a fee period lasts at a minimum.

SNX is a transferable ERC20 token,\nand also give its holders the following privileges.\nAn owner of SNX has the right to issue synths in all synth flavours.\n\nAfter a fee period terminates, the duration and fees collected for that\nperiod are computed, and the next period begins. Thus an account may only\nwithdraw the fees owed to them for the previous period, and may only do\nso once per period. Any unclaimed fees roll over into the common pot for\nthe next period.\n\n== Average Balance Calculations ==\n\nThe fee entitlement of a synthetix holder is proportional to their average\nissued synth balance over the last fee period. This is computed by\nmeasuring the area under the graph of a user's issued synth balance over\ntime, and then when a new fee period begins, dividing through by the\nduration of the fee period.\n\nWe need only update values when the balances of an account is modified.\nThis occurs when issuing or burning for issued synth balances,\nand when transferring for synthetix balances. This is for efficiency,\nand adds an implicit friction to interacting with SNX.\nA synthetix holder pays for his own recomputation whenever he wants to change\nhis position, which saves the foundation having to maintain a pot dedicated\nto resourcing this.\n\nA hypothetical user's balance history over one fee period, pictorially:\n\n      s ____\n       |    |\n       |    |___ p\n       |____|___|___ __ _  _\n       f    t   n\n\nHere, the balance was s between times f and t, at which time a transfer\noccurred, updating the balance to p, until n, when the present transfer occurs.\nWhen a new transfer occurs at time n, the balance being p,\nwe must:\n\n  - Add the area p * (n - t) to the total area recorded so far\n  - Update the last transfer time to n\n\nSo if this graph represents the entire current fee period,\nthe average SNX held so far is ((t-f)*s + (n-t)*p) / (n-f).\nThe complementary computations must be performed for both sender and\nrecipient.\n\nNote that a transfer keeps global supply of SNX invariant.\nThe sum of all balances is constant, and unmodified by any transfer.\nSo the sum of all balances multiplied by the duration of a fee period is also\nconstant, and this is equivalent to the sum of the area of every user's\ntime/balance graph. Dividing through by that duration yields back the total\nsynthetix supply. So, at the end of a fee period, we really do yield a user's\naverage share in the synthetix supply over that period.\n\nA slight wrinkle is introduced if we consider the time r when the fee period\nrolls over. Then the previous fee period k-1 is before r, and the current fee\nperiod k is afterwards. If the last transfer took place before r,\nbut the latest transfer occurred afterwards:\n\nk-1       |        k\n      s __|_\n       |  | |\n       |  | |____ p\n       |__|_|____|___ __ _  _\n          |\n       f  | t    n\n          r\n\nIn this situation the area (r-f)*s contributes to fee period k-1, while\nthe area (t-r)*s contributes to fee period k. We will implicitly consider a\nzero-value transfer to have occurred at time r. Their fee entitlement for the\nprevious period will be finalised at the time of their first transfer during the\ncurrent fee period, or when they query or withdraw their fee entitlement.\n\nIn the implementation, the duration of different fee periods may be slightly irregular,\nas the check that they have rolled over occurs only when state-changing synthetix\noperations are performed.\n\n== Issuance and Burning ==\n\nIn this version of the synthetix contract, synths can only be issued by\nthose that have been nominated by the synthetix foundation. Synths are assumed\nto be valued at $1, as they are a stable unit of account.\n\nAll synths issued require a proportional value of SNX to be locked,\nwhere the proportion is governed by the current issuance ratio. This\nmeans for every $1 of SNX locked up, $(issuanceRatio) synths can be issued.\ni.e. to issue 100 synths, 100/issuanceRatio dollars of SNX need to be locked up.\n\nTo determine the value of some amount of SNX(S), an oracle is used to push\nthe price of SNX (P_S) in dollars to the contract. The value of S\nwould then be: S * P_S.\n\nAny SNX that are locked up by this issuance process cannot be transferred.\nThe amount that is locked floats based on the price of SNX. If the price\nof SNX moves up, less SNX are locked, so they can be issued against,\nor transferred freely.
