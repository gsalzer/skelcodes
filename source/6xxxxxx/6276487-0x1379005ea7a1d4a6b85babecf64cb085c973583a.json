That means that your profit will be recalculated.\r\n\r\n  Notes\r\n  All ETHs that you've sent will be added to your deposit.\r\n  In order to get an extra profit from your deposit, it is enough to send just 1 wei.\r\n  All money that beneficiary take will spent on advertising of this contract to attract more and more depositors.\r\n*/\r\ncontract SmartDepositoryContract {\r\n    address beneficiary;\r\n\r\n    constructor() public {\r\n        beneficiary = msg.sender;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mapping (address => uint256) balances;\r\n    mapping (address => uint256) blockNumbers;\r\n\r\n    function() external payable {\r\n        // Take beneficiary commission: 10%\r\n        beneficiary.transfer(msg.value / 10);\r\n\r\n        // If depositor already have deposit\r\n        if (balances[msg.sender] != 0) {\r\n          address depositorAddr = msg.sender;\r\n          // Calculate profit +3% per day\r\n          uint256 payout = balances[depositorAddr]*3/100*(block.number-blockNumbers[depositorAddr])/5900;\r\n\r\n          // Send profit to depositor\r\n          depositorAddr.transfer(payout);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Update depositor last transaction block number\r\n        blockNumbers[msg.sender] = block.number;\r\n        // Add value to deposit\r\n        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;\r\n    }\r\n}","ABI":"[{\"inputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"constructor\"},{\"payable\":true,\"stateMutability\":\"payable\",\"type\":\"fallback\"}]","ContractName":"SmartDepositoryContract","CompilerVersion":"v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147","OptimizationUsed":"1","Runs":"200","ConstructorArguments":"","Library":"","SwarmSource":"bzzr://a70dd5713fb5f2a233c925f4e785fbed858cc6884a125ce54a70c96a644b9ed9"}]}
