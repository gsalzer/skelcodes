For example if campaign accepts Ethers only, but BS collected Bitcoins and Waves, it could be possible to convert all these to Ether and invest into campaign using Ethers.\r\n\r\n* On the day when campaign starts, Blockstarter makes one big investment into 3rd party ICO.\r\n\r\n# XBS token and economy of BlockStarter\r\n\r\nXBS tokens could be used in different cases:\r\n\r\n* Fee for usage of Blockstarter services: publish campaign, publish bounty, publish smart contract.\r\n\r\n* Payment for mass feedback to fix conceptual bugs. \r\n\r\n* Payment for promotions of campaign, bounties, jobs and it’s position in the list.\r\n\r\n* Payment for work made by contributor or employee.\r\n\r\n* Reward for bounty in contrast to unissued tokens of a project.\r\n\r\n* Payment for event posting on the Blockstarter related to the ICO to attract contributors.\r\n\r\n## Fee for usage of Blockstarter services\r\n\r\nLet’s assume that 1 XBS token = 1 USD.\r\n\r\n* When creating a new campaign it is required to topup your Blockstarter balance to 500 tokens. \r\n\r\n* 50-100 tokens (10-20% of them) go to Blockstarter.\r\n\r\n* 400 tokens left on startupper deposit. Startupper can use these tokens later to pay for work of other contributors: improve whitepaper, legal consultancy, artwork, etc.\r\n\r\n* After all startupper will have 400 XBS tokens that could be used in different cases as we see below.\r\n\r\n## Payment for promotions\r\n\r\nHaving big listing it’s always hard to be noticed naturally. Especially if you are unknown project.\r\n\r\nXBS tokens can be used to pay for promotions of crowdsale campaigns and bounties.\r\n\r\nHaving hundreds to thousands of campaigns on site it will be hard to outstand.\r\n\r\nBy paying for, let’s say 1000 tokens will give a campaign 1000 extra views by showing the campaign on the top of Blockstarter site.\r\n\r\nThe similar situation could be with bounties or job entries: there could be thousands of different bounties and to get on top of other bounties, a project will pay some XBS tokens.\r\n\r\n## Reward for bounty\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to pay for bounty with non existent tokens of any particular project that is going to launch crowdsale. This is a good way for project to save money and to get some work done for free. But from the other side this way of payment is not safe for workers/contributors, because there is a big chance that project will not success in crowdsale because of big competition between other projects.\r\n\r\nXBS tokens as a payment reward for bounty could be a good alternative. Every project could have XBS tokens on its deposit (for example after a required topup during publishing of ICO campaign), and these tokens could be used as a reward for bounty tasks instead of unissued tokens of project. XBS tokens will be more respected and safe way to pay for the job, such as they will be tradeable at that moment in contrast to unissued tokens of a project. \r\n\r\n## Payment for work\r\n\r\nXBS tokens could be used as a currency that projects will use to pay salary for their employees or as a one time payment to freelancers. What kind of work can be payed with XBS tokens?\r\n\r\n* Improve/review whitepaper.\r\n\r\n* Legal support / consultancy.\r\n\r\n* Copywriting and PR.\r\n\r\n* Programming related tasks.\r\n\r\n* Design and artwork.\r\n\r\n* Regular salary for employee.\r\n\r\n* One time payment for freelancer.\r\n\r\n## Fee from money raised during ICO\r\n\r\nBlockstarter will take next % from money each campaign raise during ICO:\r\n\r\n* 10% up to 1m USD.\r\n\r\n* 5% from 1m to 10m USD.\r\n\r\n* 2.5% from 10m USD.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# <<< START AFTER SUCCESSFUL ICO >>>\r\n\r\nPublic ICO is considered successful if Blockstarter raises more than 2,000,000 USD.\r\n\r\n# Marketplace for contributors\r\n\r\n## Contributor\r\n\r\nContributor can help a campaign in different ways, for example:\r\n\r\n### Edit Whitepaper or give a feedback\r\n\r\n### Help with coding or design work\r\n\r\n### Help with legal aspects\r\n\r\n### Help with PR\r\n\r\n### Write an article / blog post about campaign\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# APPENDIX A: Media plan for BlockStarter\r\n\r\n## Create simple blog on Blockstarter\r\n\r\n* It should be server generated (SEO friendly)\r\n\r\n* It should lightweight.
