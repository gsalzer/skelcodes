/*
  The wallet allows depositing/withdrawing funds to/from internal keyed storage.
  For convenience keys in the storage are public "address"s, and access is controlled by
  ownership of a corresponding private key.

  Public APIs:
    * put(address): To deposit money into a wallet keyed by |pub|.
    * get(signature): To withdraw money from wallet |pub|,
      sign sender's (your) wallet address by the |pub|'s private key.
      Note that API expects r,s,v values (standard for 65 byte ecdsa secp256k1 signature).
    * OWNER ONLY: rem(address): Clear wallet by sending money to the owner.
