 * PepePenguin ($PP) is a fully decentralized fair launch meme token that has been optimized for price appreciation.
 * PP collects a liquidity pool (LP) fee on each transaction that scales based on the LP size. Instead of immediately
 * depositing the LP fee back into the LP, PP optimizes the rate of deposit to increase or decrease the token's
 * volatility (speed at which the price moves) depending on the token's current value. In simple terms, PP increases
 * the speed of price appreciation in price zones of optimal price appreciation and decreases the speed of price
 * deprecation in prices zone prone to consolidation. This is achieved by the contract holding the LP fee as a token
 * reserve and slowly depositing the LP pair fee into the LP in appreciating price zones and rapidly depositing during
 * price deprecation zones. In this way PP LP dynamics help drive the market price to a steady increase followed with
 * consolidation, boosting the next increase and damping any price reductions. Further, PP has re-engineered the fair
 * launch model to allow for an optimal token wallet distribution. PP limits the maximum purchase to 1,000,000 tokens
 * per wallet and the contract will collect any amount over the maximum adding to the token LP reserves. In addition,
 * the LP of the contract has been locked forever.
