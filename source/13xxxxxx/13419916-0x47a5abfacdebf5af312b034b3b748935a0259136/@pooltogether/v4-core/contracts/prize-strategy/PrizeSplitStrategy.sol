/**
  * @title  PoolTogether V4 PrizeSplitStrategy
  * @author PoolTogether Inc Team
  * @notice Captures PrizePool interest for PrizeReserve and additional PrizeSplit recipients.
            The PrizeSplitStrategy will have at minimum a single PrizeSplit with 100% of the captured
            interest transfered to the PrizeReserve. Additional PrizeSplits can be added, depending on
            the deployers requirements (i.e. percentage to charity). In contrast to previous PoolTogether
            iterations, interest can be captured independent of a new Draw. Ideally (to save gas) interest
            is only captured when also distributing the captured prize(s) to applicable Prize Distributor(s).
