/**
 * @dev Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * Inspired and borrowed by/from the openzeppelin/contracts` {Ownable}.
 * Unlike openzeppelin` version:
 * - by default, the owner account is the one returned by the {_defaultOwner}
 * function, but not the deployer address;
 * - this contract has no constructor and may run w/o initialization;
 * - the {renounceOwnership} function removed.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 * the owner.
 * The child contract must define the {_defaultOwner} function.
