/**
 * @title ERC20Migrator
 * @dev This contract can be used to migrate an ERC20 token from one
 * contract to another, where each token holder has to opt-in to the migration.
 * To opt-in, users must approve for this contract the number of tokens they
 * want to migrate. Once the allowance is set up, anyone can trigger the
 * migration to the new token contract. In this way, token holders "turn in"
 * their old balance and will be minted an equal amount in the new token.
 * The new token contract must be mintable. For the precise interface refer to
 * OpenZeppelin's ERC20Mintable, but the only functions that are needed are
 * `isMinter(address)` and `mint(address, amount)`. The migrator will check
 * that it is a minter for the token.
 * The balance from the legacy token will be transfered to the migrator, as it
 * is migrated, and remain there forever.
 * Although this contract can be used in many different scenarios, the main
 * motivation was to provide a way to migrate ERC20 tokens into an upgradeable
 * version of it using ZeppelinOS. To read more about how this can be done
 * using this implementation, please follow the official documentation site of
 * ZeppelinOS: https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/erc20_onboarding.html
 * Example of usage:
 * ```
 * const migrator = await ERC20Migrator.new(legacyToken.address);
 * await newToken.addMinter(migrator.address);
 * await migrator.beginMigration(newToken.address);
 * ```
