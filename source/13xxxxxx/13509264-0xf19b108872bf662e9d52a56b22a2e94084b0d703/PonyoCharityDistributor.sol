    It's a Token Bridge!
    
    This will easily allow people to migrate from a V1 to a V2 token, just read the comments and make the proper updates!
    
    This contract must be excluded from fees if applicable, and also must be able to add liquidity if trading is paused, so make sure your V2 token supports that.
