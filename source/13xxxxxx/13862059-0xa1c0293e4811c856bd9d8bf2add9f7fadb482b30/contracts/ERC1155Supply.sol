 * @dev Extension of ERC1155 that adds tracking of total supply per id.
 *
 * Useful for scenarios where Fungible and Non-fungible tokens have to be
 * clearly identified. Note: While a totalSupply of 1 might mean the
 * corresponding is an NFT, there is no guarantees that no other token with the
 * same id are not going to be minted.
 *
 * Note: 2B has modified the original code to cover its needs as
 * part of artèQ Investment Fund ecosystem
