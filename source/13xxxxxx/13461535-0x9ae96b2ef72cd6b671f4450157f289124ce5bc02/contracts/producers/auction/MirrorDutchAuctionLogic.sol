/**
 * @title MirrorDutchAuctionLogic
 * @author MirrorXYZ
 *
 * This contract implements a simple Dutch Auction system.
 * The auction works as follows:
 *  - Generate a list of numbers that represent all the prices at which
 *    the assets are offered. The first item is the highest price, the last
 *    item is the lowest price.
 *  - Set a time interval that represents how much time will elapse between price changes.
 *  - After the auction starts, every bid pays the price at the time that their transaction
 *    mines and receives their asset.
 *
 * The auction can be paused and unpaused by the owner without affecting the price mechanism.
 * The auction has a "cancel" functionality that withdraws all funds (paying a fee) and
 * renounces ownership which ensures that the auction cannot be restarted again.
 * The auction assumes that tokenIds of the assets transfered are sequential, beginning at
 * "startTokenId" and ending at "endTokenId".
 * The auction uses blocks as the unit for the interval.
