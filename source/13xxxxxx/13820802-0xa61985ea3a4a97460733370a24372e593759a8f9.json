(Funds are taken from the Strategy that will disturb everyone's\\n    gains the least, then the next least, etc.) In order to achieve this, the\\n    withdrawal queue's order must be properly set and managed by the community\\n    (through governance).\\n    Vault Strategies are parameterized to pursue the highest risk-adjusted yield.\\n    There is an \\\"Emergency Shutdown\\\" mode. When the Vault is put into emergency\\n    shutdown, assets will be recalled from the Strategies as quickly as is\\n    practical (given on-chain conditions), minimizing loss. Deposits are\\n    halted, new Strategies may not be added, and each Strategy exits with the\\n    minimum possible damage to position, while opening up deposits to be\\n    withdrawn by users. There are no restrictions on withdrawals above what is\\n    expected under Normal Operation.\\n    For further details, please refer to the specification:\\n    https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-vaults/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md\\n    **/\\ninterface IVault {\\n    /**\\n    @dev Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.\\n    */\\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256 balance);\\n\\n    /**\\n    @notice Gives the price for a single Vault share.\\n    @dev See dev note on `withdraw`.\\n    @return singleShareValue : The value of a single share.\\n    */\\n    function pricePerShare() external view returns (uint256 singleShareValue);\\n\\n    /**\\n    @notice\\n        Deposits `_amount` `token`, issuing shares to `recipient`.
