/**
 * @dev This contract allows for non-custodial Gitcoin Grants match payouts. It works as follows:
 *  1. During a matching round, deploy a new instance of this contract
 *  2. Once the round is complete, Gitcoin computes the final match amounts earned by each grant
 *  3. Over the course of multiple transactions, the contract owner will set the payout mapping
 *     stored in the `payouts` variable. This maps each grant receiving address to the match amount
 *     owed, in DAI
 *  4. Once this mapping has been set for each grant, the contract owner calls `finalize()`. This
 *     sets `finalized` to `true`, and at this point the payout mapping can no longer be updated.
 *  5. Funders review the payout mapping, and if they approve they transfer their funds to this
 *     contract. This can be done with an ordinary transfer to this contract address.
 *  6. Once all funds have been transferred, the contract owner calls `enablePayouts` which lets
 *     grant owners withdraw their match payments
 *  6. Grant owners can now call `withdraw()` to have their match payout sent to their address.
 *     Anyone can call this method on behalf of a grant owner, which is useful if your Gitcoin
 *     grants address cannot call contract methods.
 *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 *        WARNING: DO NOT SEND ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR DAI TO THIS CONTRACT OR IT WILL BE LOST!        *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
