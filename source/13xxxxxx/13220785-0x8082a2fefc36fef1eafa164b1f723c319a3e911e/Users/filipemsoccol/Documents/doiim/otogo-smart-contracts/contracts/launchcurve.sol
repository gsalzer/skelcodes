     * Returns the amount of tokens that user will receive in return of staked amount.
     * In case of stake not be 18 decimal, is needed to normalize it.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `supply` The total supply of the launch pool.
     * - `pool` The current balance of the pool to be calculated.
     * - `stake` The current stake to return the amount of tokens to return.
     * - `reducer` The reducerr factor to make curve less exponential. Recommended 1 to 400.
