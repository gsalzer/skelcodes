 *  @dev A contract between two parties which can be arbitrated. Both parties has to pay for the arbitration fee. The winning party will get its fee refunded.
 *  To develop a contract inheriting from this one, you need to:
 *  - Redefine RULING_OPTIONS to explain the consequences of the possible rulings.
 *  - Redefine executeRuling while still calling super.executeRuling to implement the results of the arbitration.
