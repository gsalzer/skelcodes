             * favorably priced for users.  Example:
             *
             * 1. storedPrice = $1,000, and bidAskAdjustment = 1.02.  So, our current ETH buy price is $1,020, and our current
             *    ETH sell price is $1,000 (mid).
             * 2. The oracle comes back with a fresh price (newer updateTime) of $990.
             * 3. The currently adjusted price is buy price (ie, adj > 1).  So, we want to:
             *    a) Update storedPrice (mid) to $990.
             *    b) Update bidAskAdj to ensure that buy price remains >= $1,020.
             * 4. We do this by upping bidAskAdj 1.02 -> 1.0303.  Then the new buy price will remain $990 * 1.0303 = $1,020.
             *    The sell price will remain the unadjusted mid: formerly $1,000, now $990.
             *
             * Because the bidAskAdjustment reverts to 1 in a few minutes, the new 3.03% buy premium is temporary: buy price
             * will revert to the $990 mid soon - unless the new mid is egregiously low, in which case buyers should push it
             * back up.  Eg, suppose the oracle gives us a glitchy price of $99.  Then new mid = $99, bidAskAdj = 10.303, buy
             * price = $1,020, and the buy price will rapidly drop towards $99; but as it does so, users are incentivized to
             * step in and buy, eventually pushing mid back up to the real-world ETH market price (eg $990).
             *
             * In cases like this, our bidAskAdj update has protected the system, by preventing users from getting any chance

     * 1. Suppose the system currently contains 50 ETH at price $1,000 (total pool value: $50,000), with an actual USM supply
     *    of 30,000 USM.  Then debt ratio = 30,000 / $50,000 = 60%: < MAX 80%, so `usmSupplyForFumBuys` = 30,000.
     * 2. Now suppose ETH/USD halves to $500.  Then pool value halves to $25,000, and debt ratio doubles to 120%.  Now
     *    `usmSupplyForFumBuys` instead = 20,000: the USM quantity at which debt ratio would equal 80% (20,000 / $25,000).
     *    (Call this the "80% supply".)
     * 3. ...Except, we also gradually increase the supply over time while we remain underwater.  This has the effect of
     *    *reducing* the FUM buy price inferred from that supply (higher JacobUSM supply -> smaller buffer -> lower FUM price).
     *    The math we use gradually increases the supply from its initial "80% supply" value, where debt ratio =
     *    `MAX_DEBT_RATIO` (20,000 above), to a theoretical maximum "100% supply" value, where debt ratio = 100% (in the $500
     *    example above, this would be 25,000).  (Or the actual supply, whichever is lower: we never increase
     *    `usmSupplyForFumBuys` above `usmActualSupply`.)  The climb from the initial 80% supply (20,000) to the 100% supply
     *    (25,000) is at a rate that brings it "halfway closer per `minFumBuyPrice` half-life (eg, 1 day)": so three days after
     *    going underwater, the supply returned will be 25,000 - 0.5**3 * (25,000 - 20,000) = 24,375.
