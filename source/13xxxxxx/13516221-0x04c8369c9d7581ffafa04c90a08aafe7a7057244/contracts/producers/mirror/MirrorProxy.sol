 * proxies are used with the proxy-relayer pattern. The proxy delegates calls
 * to a relayer contract that calls into the storage contract. The proxy uses the
 * EIP-1967 standard to store the "implementation" logic, which in our case is
 * the relayer contract. The relayer logic is directly stored into the standard
 * slot using `sstore` in the constructor, and read using `sload` in the fallback
 * function.
