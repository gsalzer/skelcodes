     * claimRewardsToChain allows darknode operators to withdraw darknode
     * earnings, as an on-chain alternative to the JSON-RPC claim method.
     *
     * It will the operators total sum of rewards, for all of their nodes.
     *
     * @param assetSymbol The token symbol being claimed (e.g. "BTC", "DOGE" or
     *        "FIL").
     * @param recipientAddress An address on the asset's native chain, for
     *        receiving the withdrawn rewards. This should be a string as
     *        provided by the user - no encoding or decoding required.
     *        E.g.: "miMi2VET41YV1j6SDNTeZoPBbmH8B4nEx6" for BTC.
     * @param recipientChain A string indicating which chain the rewards should
     *        be withdrawn to. It should be the name of the chain as expected by
     *        RenVM (e.g. "Ethereum" or "Solana"). Support for different chains
     *        will be rolled out after this contract is deployed, starting with
     *        "Ethereum", then other host chains (e.g. "Polygon" or "Solana")
     *        and then lock chains (e.g. "Bitcoin" for "BTC"), also represented
     *        by an empty string "".
     * @param recipientPayload An associated payload that can be provided along
     *        with the recipient chain and address. Should be empty if not
     *        required.
     * @param fractionInBps A value between 0 and 10000 (inclusive) that
     *        indicates the percent to withdraw from each of the operator's
     *        darknodes. The value should be in BPS (e.g. 10000 represents 100%,
     *        and 5000 represents 50%).
