Reggie provides Vera a public key\\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\\n *\\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\\n * @dev from the output space.\\n *\\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.\\n * *****************************************************************************\\n * @dev USAGE\\n *\\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\\n * @dev shown:\\n *\\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\\n * @dev     constuctor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {\\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\\n * @dev       }\\n * @dev   }\\n *\\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK\\n * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and\\n * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you\\n * @dev want to generate randomness from.\\n *\\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.\\n *\\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value\\n * @dev generated from your seed.\\n *\\n * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by\\n * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent\\n * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is\\n * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more\\n * @dev details. (See \\\"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\\\" for principles to keep in mind,\\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.)\\n *\\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\\n * @dev differ.

If your contract must store the response (or\\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\\n *\\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the\\n * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact\\n * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API\\n * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.\\n *\\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\\n * @dev cost.
