    /// MARKETPLACE

    // this contract includes a maker / taker offerplace
    // (similar to those seen in OpenSea, 0x Protocol and other NFT projects) 
    //
    // offers are made by makers off-chain and filled by callers on-chain
    // makers do this by signing their offer with their wallet 
    // smart contracts can't be makers because they can't sign messages
    // if a witness address is set then it must sign the offer hash too (eg. the website marketplace)

    // there are two types of offers depending on whether the maker specifies a taker in their offer:
    // maker / taker       (peer-to-peer offer:  two users agreeing to trade items)
    // maker / no taker    (open offer:  one user listing their items in the marketplace)

    // if eth is paid then it will always be on the taker side (the maker never pays eth in this simplified model)
    // a market fee is charged if eth is paid
    // trading tokens with no eth is free and no fee is deducted

    // allowed exchanges:

    //   maker tokens  > <  eth                          (maker sells their tokens to anyone)
    //   maker tokens  >                                 (maker gives their tokens away to anyone)

    //   maker tokens  >    taker                        (maker gives their tokens to a specific taker)
    //   maker tokens  > <  taker tokens                     .. for specific tokens back
    //   maker tokens  > <  taker tokens & eth               .. for specific tokens and eth back 
    //   maker tokens  > <  taker eth                        .. for eth only

    //   maker           <  taker tokens                 (taker gives their tokens to the maker)
