/// @notice The (older) MasterChef contract gives out a constant number of DRINK tokens per block.
/// MasterChef the only address with minting rights for DRINK.
/// The idea for this contract is therefore to be the dummy LP token that is deposited into the MasterChef V1 (MCV1) contract.
/// The allocation point for this pool on MCV1 is the total allocation point for all pools that receive incentives on L2.
