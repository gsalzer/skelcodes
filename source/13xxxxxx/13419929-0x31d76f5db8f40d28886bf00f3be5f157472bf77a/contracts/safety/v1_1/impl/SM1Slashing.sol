/**
 * @title SM1Slashing
 * @author dYdX
 *
 * @dev Provides the slashing function for removing funds from the contract.
 *
 *  SLASHING:
 *
 *   All funds in the contract, active or inactive, are slashable. Slashes are recorded by updating
 *   the exchange rate, and to simplify the technical implementation, we disallow full slashes.
 *   To reduce the possibility of overflow in the exchange rate, we place an upper bound on the
 *   fraction of funds that may be slashed in a single slash.
 *
 *   Warning: Slashing is not possible if the slash would cause the exchange rate to overflow.
 *
 *  REWARDS AND GOVERNANCE POWER ACCOUNTING:
 *
 *   Since all slashes are accounted for by a global exchange rate, slashes do not require any
 *   update to staked balances. The earning of rewards is unaffected by slashes.
 *
 *   Governance power takes slashes into account by using snapshots of the exchange rate inside
 *   the getPowerAtBlock() function. Note that getPowerAtBlock() returns the governance power as of
 *   the end of the specified block.
