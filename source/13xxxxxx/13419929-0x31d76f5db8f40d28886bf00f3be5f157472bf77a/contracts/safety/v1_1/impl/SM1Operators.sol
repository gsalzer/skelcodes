 * @title SM1Operators
 * @author dYdX
 *
 * @dev Actions which may be called by authorized operators, nominated by the contract owner.
 *
 *  There are two types of operators. These should be smart contracts, which can be used to
 *  provide additional functionality to users:
 *
 *  STAKE_OPERATOR_ROLE:
 *
 *    This operator is allowed to request withdrawals and withdraw funds on behalf of stakers. This
 *    role could be used by a smart contract to provide a staking interface with additional
 *    features, for example, optional lock-up periods that pay out additional rewards (from a
 *    separate rewards pool).
 *
 *  CLAIM_OPERATOR_ROLE:
 *
 *    This operator is allowed to claim rewards on behalf of stakers. This role could be used by a
 *    smart contract to provide an interface for claiming rewards from multiple incentive programs
 *    at once.
