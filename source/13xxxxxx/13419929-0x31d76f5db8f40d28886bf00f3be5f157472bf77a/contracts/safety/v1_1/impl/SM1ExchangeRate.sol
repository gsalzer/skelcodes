/**
 * @title SM1ExchangeRate
 * @author dYdX
 *
 * @dev Performs math using the exchange rate, which converts between underlying units of the token
 *  that was staked (e.g. STAKED_TOKEN.balanceOf(account)), and staked units, used by this contract
 *  for all staked balances (e.g. this.balanceOf(account)).
 *
 *  OVERVIEW:
 *
 *   The exchange rate is stored as a multiple of EXCHANGE_RATE_BASE, and represents the number of
 *   staked balance units that each unit of underlying token is worth. Before any slashes have
 *   occurred, the exchange rate is equal to one. The exchange rate can increase with each slash,
 *   indicating that staked balances are becoming less and less valuable, per unit, relative to the
 *   underlying token.
 *
 *  AVOIDING OVERFLOW AND UNDERFLOW:
 *
 *   Staked balances are represented internally as uint240, so the result of an operation returning
 *   a staked balances must return a value less than 2^240. Intermediate values in calcuations are
 *   represented as uint256, so all operations within a calculation must return values under 2^256.
 *
 *   In the functions below operating on the exchange rate, we are strategic in our choice of the
 *   order of multiplication and division operations, in order to avoid both overflow and underflow.
 *
 *   We use the following assumptions and principles to implement this module:
 *     - (ASSUMPTION) An amount denoted in underlying token units is never greater than 10^28.
 *     - If the exchange rate is greater than 10^46, then we may perform division on the exchange
 *         rate before performing multiplication, provided that the denominator is not greater
 *         than 10^28 (to ensure a result with at least 18 decimals of precision). Specifically,
 *         we use EXCHANGE_RATE_MAY_OVERFLOW as the cutoff, which is a number greater than 10^46.
 *     - Since staked balances are stored as uint240, we cap the exchange rate to ensure that a
 *         staked balance can never overflow (using the assumption above).
