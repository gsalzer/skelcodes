/**
 *  @title RealitioArbitratorWithAppealsBase
 *  @dev A Realitio arbitrator base implementation that uses Realitio v2.x and Kleros. It notifies Realitio contract for arbitration requests and creates corresponding dispute on Kleros. Transmits Kleros ruling to Realitio contract. Maintains crowdfunded appeals and notifies Kleros contract. Provides a function to submit evidence for Kleros dispute. This contract is abstract as it does not have a function to report answer, see child contracts.
 *  There is a conversion between Kleros ruling and Realitio answer and there is a need for shifting by 1. This is because ruling 0 in Kleros signals tie or no-ruling but in Realitio 0 is a valid answer. For reviewers this should be a focus as it's quite easy to get confused. Any mistakes on this conversion will render this contract useless.
 *  NOTE: This contract trusts the Kleros arbitrator and Realitio.
