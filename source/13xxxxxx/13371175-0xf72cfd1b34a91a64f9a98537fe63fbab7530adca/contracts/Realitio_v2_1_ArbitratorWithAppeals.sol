/**
 *  @title Realitio_v2_1_ArbitratorWithAppeals
 *  @dev A Realitio arbitrator implementation that uses Realitio v2.1 and Kleros. It notifies Realitio contract for arbitration requests and creates corresponding dispute on Kleros.
 *  Transmits Kleros ruling to Realitio contract. Maintains crowdfunded appeals and notifies Kleros contract. Provides a function to submit evidence for Kleros dispute.
 *  There is a conversion between Kleros ruling and Realitio answer and there is a need for shifting by 1. This is because ruling 0 in Kleros signals tie or no-ruling but in Realitio 0 is a valid answer.
 *  For reviewers this should be a focus as it's quite easy to get confused. Any mistakes on this conversion will render this contract useless.
 *  NOTE: This contract trusts the Kleros arbitrator and Realitio.
