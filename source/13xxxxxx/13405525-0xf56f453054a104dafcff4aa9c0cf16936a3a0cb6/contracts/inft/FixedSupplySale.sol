/**
 * @title Fixed Supply Sale
 *
 * @notice Fixed Supply Sale sales fixed amount of iNFTs for a fixed price in a fixed period of time;
 *      underlying NFTs and AI Personalities are being minted as well as a part of the sale process
 *
 * @notice In restricted mode (FEATURE_PUBLIC_SALE feature disabled) sells the items only to
 *      accounts having `ROLE_BUYER` permission (used to mint first hundred iNFTs in the 10k sale campaign)
 *
 * @dev Technically, all the "fixed" parameters can be changed on the go after smart contract is deployed
 *      and operational, but this ability is reserved for quick fix-like adjustments, and to provide
 *      an ability to restart and run a similar sale after the previous one ends
 *
 * @dev When buying an iNFT from this smart contract:
 *      1) next NFT is minted to the transaction sender address
 *      2) next AI Personality is minted directly to iNFT smart contract for further locking
 *      3) next iNFT is created, bound to an NFT minted in step (1)
 *         and locking the AI Personality minted in step (2)
 *      4) no ALI tokens are minted, no ALI tokens are locked or consumed in the process
 *
 * @dev Deployment and setup:
 *      1. Deploy smart contract, specify smart contract addresses during the deployment
 *         - iNFT deployed instance address
 *         - NFT deployed instance address
 *         - AI Personality deployed instance address
 *      2. Execute `initialize` function and set up the sale parameters;
 *         sale is not active until it's initialized
