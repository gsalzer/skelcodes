/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * NOTES: This is an adaptation of the Open Zeppelin ERC20, with changes made per audit
 * requests, and to fit overall Swivel Style. We use it specifically as the base for
 * the Erc2612 hence the `Perc` (Permissioned erc20) naming.
 *
 * Dangling underscores are generally not allowed within swivel style but the 
 * internal, abstracted implementation methods inherted from the O.Z contract are maintained here.
 * Hence, when you see a dangling underscore prefix, you know it is *only* allowed for
 * one of these method calls. It is not allowed for any other purpose. These are:
     _approve
     _transfer
     _mint
     _burn
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
