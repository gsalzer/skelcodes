6. Use their NFTs to interact with websites and apps, including decentralized 
apps (dapps).

### 2.B. Owners of Terraforms NFTs cannot:

release derivative works of the Art of NFTs they do not currently own.
3. Register or attempt to enforce any intellectual property rights in any

If an owner, together with its direct and indirect affiliates, operates an 
enterprise that has ten (10) or more employees or US$5,000,000 or more per year

annual revenue from commercializing its NFTs or derivatives without separate 
written permission from Mathcastles.

## 3. Terms

### 3.A. Definitions

“**Art**” means any art, design, and related underlying data that may be 
associated with an NFT that you Own.

"**Commercial Enterprise**" means any natural person, incorporated entity, or 
other commercial venture, together with its direct and indirect owners and 
affiliates, which during any of the last three calendar years had, in the 
aggregate, (i) ten (10) or more employees or (ii) the equivalent of 
US$5,000,000 or more per year in gross receipts.

"**Creator**" means Mathcastles LLC.

“**Derivatives**” means extensions or derivative works created by you of 
Purchased NFTs that include, or contain or are derived from the Art.

"**NFT**" means an Ethereum blockchain-tracked non-fungible token created from
this contract.

“**Own**” means, with respect to an NFT, an NFT that you have purchased or 
otherwise rightfully acquired, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the 
relevant blockchain, and that you continue to possess.

“**Purchased NFT**” means an NFT that you Own.

“**Third Party IP**” means any third party patent rights (including, without 
limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, 
trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any 
country or jurisdiction in the world.

### 3.B. Ownership

You acknowledge and agree that Creator (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns 
all legal right, title and interest in and to the Art, and all intellectual 
property rights therein. The rights that you have in and to the Art are limited 
to those described in this License. Creator reserves all rights in and to the 
Art not expressly granted to you in this License.

### 3.C. License

#### 3.C.1. General Use

Subject to your continued compliance with the terms of this License, Creator 
grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to 
use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased NFTs, along with any 
Derivatives that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes:

1. for your own personal, non-commercial use;
2. as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your NFTs; or
3. as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, 
involvement, or participation of your NFTs.

#### 3.C.2. Commercial and Derivative Use

Creator grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license 
to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased NFTs for the purpose of 
commercializing your own physical or virtual merchandise that includes, 
contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased NFTs (“**Commercial Use**”) 
and to commercialize Derivatives of your Purchased NFTs ("**Derivative Use**"), 
provided that if you are a Commercial Enterprise, such Commercial Use and 
Derivative Use do not in the aggregate result in you earning more than Five 
Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$500,000) in gross revenue in any year. For 
the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section 3.C.2. will be deemed to restrict 
you from:

1. owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of NFTs 
generally;
2. owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the 
inclusion, involvement, or participation of NFTs generally; or
3. earning revenue from any of the foregoing, even where such revenue is in 
excess of US$500,000 per year.

### 3.D. Restrictions

#### 3.D.1. No Additional IP Rights

You may not attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional 
intellectual property rights in the Art, nor permit any third party to do or 
attempt to do any of the foregoing, without Creator’s express prior written 
consent; _provided_, that this section does not prohibit an owner from acquiring 
intellectual property rights in a derivative work.

#### 3.D.2. No License Granted as to Third Party IP

To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs contains Third Party 
IP (for example, licensed intellectual property from a third party artist, 
company, or public figure), you understand and agree as follows:

1. that the inclusion of any Third Party IP in the Art does not grant you any 
rights to use such Third Party IP except as it is incorporated in the Art;
2. that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the 
Third Party IP, Creator may need to pass through additional restrictions on your 
ability to use the Art; and
3. to the extent that Creator informs you of such additional restrictions in 
writing (including by email), you will be responsible for complying with all 
such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure 
to do so will be deemed a breach of this license.

The restrictions in this Section 3.D. will survive the expiration or termination 
of this License.

### 3.E. Limitations of License

Except for the right to Derivative Use described in Section 3.C.2., the license 
granted in this Section 3 applies only to the extent that you continue to Own 
the applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, 
transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased NFT for any reason, the license 
granted in Section 3 (except for the right to Derivative Use described in 
Section 3.C.2.) will immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the 
requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for 
those NFTs. The right to Derivative Use described in Section 3.C.2. shall 
continue indefinitely for so long as you comply with this License.

If you are a Commercial Enterprise and you exceed the US$500,000 limitation on 
annual gross revenue set forth in Section 3.C.2. above, you will be in breach of 
this License, and must send an email to Creator at license@mathcastles.xyz 
within fifteen (15) days, with the phrase “NFT License - Commercial Use” in the 
subject line, requesting a discussion with Creator regarding entering into a 
broader license agreement or obtaining an exemption (which may be granted or 
withheld in Creator’s sole and absolute discretion).

If you exceed the scope of the license grant in this Section 3 without entering 
into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption from Creator, 
you acknowledge and agree that:

1. you are in breach of this License;
2. in addition to any remedies that may be available to Creator at law or in 
equity, the Creator may immediately terminate this License, without the 
requirement of notice; and
3. you will be responsible to reimburse Creator for any costs and expenses 
incurred by Creator during the course of enforcing the terms of this License 
against you.
