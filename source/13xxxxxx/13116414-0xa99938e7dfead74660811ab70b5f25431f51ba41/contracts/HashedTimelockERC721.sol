/**
* @title Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) on Ethereum ERC721 tokens.
*
* This contract provides a way to create and keep HTLCs for ERC721 tokens.
*
* See HashedTimelock.sol for a contract that provides the same functions
* for the native ETH token.
*
* Protocol:
*
*  1) newContract(receiver, hashlock, timelock, tokenContract, tokenId) - a
*      sender calls this to create a new HTLC on a given token (tokenContract)
*       for a given token ID. A 32 byte contract id is returned
*  2) withdraw(contractId, preimage) - once the receiver knows the preimage of
*      the hashlock hash they can claim the tokens with this function
*  3) refund() - after timelock has expired and if the receiver did not
*      withdraw the tokens the sender / creater of the HTLC can get their tokens
*      back with this function.
