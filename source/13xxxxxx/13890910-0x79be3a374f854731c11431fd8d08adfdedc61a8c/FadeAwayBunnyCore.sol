    // This is the main CryptoKitties contract. In order to keep our code seperated into logical sections,
    // we've broken it up in two ways. First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts
    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are
    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping
    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks
    // FadeAwayBunny ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of
    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.
    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!
    //
    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major
    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still
    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:
    //
    //      - FadeAwayBunnyBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core
    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus
    //             internal functions for managing these items.
    //
    //      - FadeAwayBunnyAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations
    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.
    //
    //      - FadeAwayBunnyOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token
    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).
    //
    //      - FadeAwayBunnyBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed cats together, including
    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.
    //
    //      - FadeAwayBunnyAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on cats or siring
    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one
    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated
    //             through this facet of the core contract.
    //
    //      - FadeAwayBunnyMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats.
    //             We can make up to 5000 "promo" cats that can be given away (especially important when
    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up
    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they
    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 50k gen0 cats. After that, it's all up to the
    //             community to breed, breed, breed!
