/**
 * @title Abstract manageable contract that can be inherited by other contracts
 * @notice Contract module based on Ownable which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an owner and a manager that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
 *
 * By default, the owner is the deployer of the contract.
 *
 * The owner account is set through a two steps process.
 *      1. The current `owner` calls {transferOwnership} to set a `pendingOwner`
 *      2. The `pendingOwner` calls {acceptOwnership} to accept the ownership transfer
 *
 * The manager account needs to be set using {setManager}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyManager`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 * the manager.
