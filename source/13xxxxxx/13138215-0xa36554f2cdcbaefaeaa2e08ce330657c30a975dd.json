If your contract must store the response (or\r\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\r\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\r\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\r\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\r\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\r\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\r\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the\r\n * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact\r\n * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API\r\n * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.\r\n *\r\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\r\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\r\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\r\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\r\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\r\n * @dev to the VRF.
