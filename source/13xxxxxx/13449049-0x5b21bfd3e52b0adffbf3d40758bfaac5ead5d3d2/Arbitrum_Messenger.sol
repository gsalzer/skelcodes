// Arbitrum. A retryable ticket is an L2 message encoded and delivered by L1; if gas is provided, it will be executed
// immediately. If no gas is provided or the execution reverts, it will be placed in the L2 retry buffer,
// where any user can re-execute for some fixed period (roughly one week).
// Retryable tickets are created by calling Inbox.createRetryableTicket.
