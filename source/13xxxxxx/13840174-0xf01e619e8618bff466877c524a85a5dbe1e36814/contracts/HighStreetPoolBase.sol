 * @title HighStreet Pool Base
 *
 * @notice An abstract contract containing common logic for a core pool (permanent pool like HIGH/ETH or HIGH pool)
 *
 * @dev Deployment and initialization.
 *      Any pool deployed must be bound to the deployed pool factory (HighStreetPoolFactory)
 *      Additionally, 3 token instance addresses must be defined on deployment:
 *          - HIGH token address
 *          - pool token address, it can be HIGH token address, HIGH/ETH pair address, and others
 *
 * @dev Pool weight defines the fraction of the yield current pool receives among the other pools,
 *      pool factory is responsible for the weight synchronization between the pools.
 * @dev The weight is logically 20% for HIGH pool and 80% for HIGH/ETH pool.
 *      Since Solidity doesn't support fractions the weight is defined by the division of
 *      pool weight by total pools weight (sum of all registered pools within the factory)
 * @dev For HIGH Pool we use 200 as weight and for HIGH/ETH pool - 800.
