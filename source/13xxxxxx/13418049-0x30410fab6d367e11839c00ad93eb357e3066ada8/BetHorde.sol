/** @title BetHorde: decentralised bets.
  * @author u/bethorde
  * @notice Truly decentralised bets. No trust. No oracles. Provably random.
  *
  *  Anyone can be a player or a house. Randomness through RSA signatures.
  *
  *  Takes:
  *    If player loses, they lose amount that they bet.
  *    If player wins, they receive:
  *      odds * bet price * (1 - (house take + contract take)).
  *    House take: 0% <= house take <= 10% (0.01% increments, set by house).
  *    Contract take (where pot = odds * bet price):
  *      Pot < 0.1 ETH:         1.0% take
  *      0.1 ETH < Pot < 1 ETH: 0.5% take
  *      1 ETH < Pot < 5 ETH:   0.2% take
  *      Pot > 5 ETH:           0.1% take
  *
  *  Play:
  *    Players call 'CreatePlayer' to create an account and play with 'PlaceBet'.
  *      Funds can be added during calls to 'PlaceBet'.
  *      Withdrawals can be made using 'PlayerWithdraw'.
  *      If house takes over 24 hours to decide a bet, 'ForceBet' can be called.
  *    Houses call 'OpenOrAdjustHouse' to set up a house.
  *      Set min_bet and max_loss parameters to limit incoming bets.
  *      Call 'DecideBet' on incoming bets within 24 hours (or a house loss can be forced).
  *      Call 'FundHouse' to add funds to a house,
  *      Call 'TogglePauseHouse' to pause/unpause a house. While a house is
  *      paused, and if all bets have been decided, house can call
  *      'HouseWithdraw' and 'OpenOrAdjustHouse'. No new bets can be placed while a house is paused.
  *    Anyone can call `ForceBet` if a house has not decided a bet within 24 hours.
  *      Results in player winning.
  *      House take goes to house address that called `ForceBet`.
  *      Funds can only be withdrawn if house exists.
  *      House can be set up after funds arrive without losing funds.
  * 
  *  Randomness:
  *    House provides public part of an RSA key in advance.
  *    Player provides randomness when placing a bet.
  *    Randomness is combined with a nonce and hashed.
  *    House signs hash in bet with house private key.
  *    Unless player knows the key, there is no way to cheat.
  *
  *  This scheme works on four facts/assumptions:
  *    1. House uses a secure 2048 bit RSA key.
  *    2. House cannot control random input from player.
  *    3. Player cannot predict how private key will sign random value.
  *    4. An RSA key can only sign a given message in one way.
  *
  *  A few ways to cheat are dealt with:
  *    1. Players can replay winning 'random' values to keep winning.
  *      - Randomness combined with other data, including a nonce, and hashed.
  *    2. Changing house parameters or withdrawing funds to avoid incoming bets.
  *      - Houses must be paused and have no unresolved bets to take these actions.
  *      - Pauses start 250 blocks after being requested.
  *      - 'PlaceBet' function has a bet_placed_timestamp parameter, preventing
  *        bets from being placed after house parameters have changed.
  *    3. House bets against itself to run out of funds for upcoming losing bets.
  *      - Last_low_balance_timestamp marks recent low funds.
  *    4. Private keys could be insecure/leaked.
  *      - House can change keys and is incentivised not to pick insecure keys.
  *      - 2048 bit RSA keys.
  * 
  *  Signing:
  *    (EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 in RFC 3447)
  *    1. Generate 2048 bit RSA key.
  *      - d: private exponent.
  *      - n: modulus (public, 2048 bits).
  *      - e: public exponent (must be 17).
  *    2. When creating (or adjusting) a house, supply n as bytes32[8].
  *    3. When signing a bet, pad the 32 byte bet.randomness value:
  *      [0x0001ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
  *       0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
  *       0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
  *       0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
  *       0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
  *       0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,
  *       0x0001fffffffffffffffffff0013031300d060960864801650304020105000420,
  *       <32 byte bet.randomness>]
  *    5. Sign array (treat it as a large hexadecimal integer):
  *      - (padded ^ d) % n.
  *    6. Supply signed value as bytes32[8] to 'DecideBet'.
