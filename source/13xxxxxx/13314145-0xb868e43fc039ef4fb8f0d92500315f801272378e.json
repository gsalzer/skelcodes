When a snapshot is created, the balances and\\n * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\\n *\\n * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\\n * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\\n * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\\n * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\\n *\\n * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\\n * snapshot id.
