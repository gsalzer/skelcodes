Defactor provides a gateway for traditional businesses to access the billions
of dollars currently available in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) liquidity pools,
offering a pipeline of real-world assets that can bring enormous value to the
DeFi ecosystem. Defactor will spawn new business models and new financial
products and services based on DeFi.  Defactor will help cement DeFi as a true
competitor to traditional finance.
