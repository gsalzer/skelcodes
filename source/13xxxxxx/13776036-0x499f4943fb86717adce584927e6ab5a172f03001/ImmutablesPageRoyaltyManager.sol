 * @dev This contract allows to split Ether royalty payments between the
 * Immutables.co contract and an Immutables.co page royaltyRecipient.
 *
 * `ImmutablesPageRoyaltyManager` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments
 * are not automatically forwarded to the accounts but kept in this contract,
 * and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the
 * {release} function.
 *
 * The contract is written to serve as an implementation for minimal proxy clones.
