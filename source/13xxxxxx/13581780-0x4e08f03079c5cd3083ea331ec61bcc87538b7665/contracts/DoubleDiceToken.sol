 * @title DoubleDice DODI token contract
 * @author DoubleDice Team <dev@doubledice.com>
 * @custom:security-contact dev@doubledice.com
 * @notice ERC-20 token extended with special yield-distribution functionality.
 *
 * A supply of 10 billion DODI was minted at contract creation: 
 * - 6.3 billion were minted to an initial token holder `initTokenHolder` 
 * - 3.7 billion were minted to a reserved `UNDISTRIBUTED_YIELD_ACCOUNT` address 
 * 
 * It is not possible to mint further DODI beyond the 10 billion DODI minted at contract creation. 
 *
 * The DODI on the `UNDISTRIBUTED_YIELD_ACCOUNT` is controlled by the `owner()` of this contract. 
 * The `owner()` may choose to: 
 * - Distribute a portion or all of the remaining undistributed yield to token holders via `distributeYield` 
 * - Burn a portion or all of the remaining undistributed yield via `burnUndistributedYield`, 
 *   thus decreasing the total DODI supply 
 *
 * The `owner()` of this contract has no special powers besides the ability 
 * to distribute or burn the 3.7 billion DODI yield.
 *
 * When an amount of yield is released from `UNDISTRIBUTED_YIELD_ACCOUNT` to be distributed to token 
 * holders, it is transferred to a second reserved `UNCLAIMED_DISTRIBUTED_YIELD_ACCOUNT` address. 
 * Token holders may then call `claimYield()` to transfer their received yield
 * from `UNCLAIMED_DISTRIBUTED_YIELD_ACCOUNT` to themselves.
 * 
 * Different operations affect `balanceOf(account)` and `unclaimedYieldOf(account)` as follows: 
 * - `transfer` and `transferFrom` alter `balanceOf(account)`, 
 *   but without altering `unclaimedYieldOf(account)`. 
 * - Unless `account` is explicitly excluded from a distribution, `distributeYield` alters `unclaimedYieldOf(account)`,
 *   but without altering `balanceOf(account)`. 
 * - `claimYield` and `claimYieldFor` alter both `balanceOf(account)` and `unclaimedYieldOf(account)`,
 *   but without altering their sum `balanceOf(account) + unclaimedYieldOf(account)`
