* ABBEY DEFI
* ========== 
* 1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is designed to be globally inclusive. 
* 2. Centralized finance is based around private share sales to wealthy individuals or
*    the trading of shares on national stock markets, both have high barriers to entry. 
* 3. The Abbey DeFi methodology offers public and private companies exposure to DeFi.
*
* Abbey is a Uniswap-based DeFi service provider that allows companies to offer people a 
* novel way to speculate on the success of their business in a decentralized manner.
* 
* The premise is both elegant and simple, the company commits to a token buyback based on 
* its sales revenue and commits to stabilize a tokens price by adding to the liquidity pool.
* 
* Using Abbey as a Uniswap DeFi management agency, the company spends sales revenue, as ETH, 
* buying one side of a bespoke Uniswap trading pair. The other side of the Uniswap pair 
* is the TNDY token.
* 
* DeFi traders wishing to speculate on the revenue growth of the company deposit ETH in return 
* for GCAC Uniswap tokens. The Uniswap Automated Market Maker ensures DeFi market 
* liquidity and legitimate price discovery. The more ETH that the company deposits over time, 
* the higher the value of the GCAC token, as held by DeFi speculators.
