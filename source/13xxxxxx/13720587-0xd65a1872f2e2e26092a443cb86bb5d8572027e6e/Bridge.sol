   * - transactionFee - array with the fees:
   *   - transactionFee[0] - fee in BRL - this fee will be added to amount transfered from caller's account.
   *   - transactionFee[1] - gas price for fee in destiny currency(minor unit) - this information will be
   *      used in the destination Blockchain,
   *      by the monitor who will create the transaction and send using this fee defined here.
   * - toBlockchain - the amount will be sent to this blockchain.
   * - toAddress - the amount will be sent to this address. It can be diferent from caller's address.
   * This is a string because some blockchain could not have the same pattern from Ethereum / RSK / BSC.

   *
   * ERC-20 tokens approve and transferFrom pattern:
   * [eip-20#transferfrom](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#transferfrom)
   *
   * Requirements:
   * - fee in BRZ (transactionFee[0]) must be at least (BRZFactorFee[blockchainName] * minGasPrice[toBlockchain]).
   * - gasPrice (transactionFee[1]) in destiny blockchain (minor unit) greater than minGasPrice in toBlockchain.
   * - toBlockchain exists.
   * - toAddress is not an empty string.
   * - amount must be greater than minTokenAmount in toBlockchain.
   * - amount greater than zero.
   *
   * Actions:
   * - add the blockchain fee in BRZ to amount in BRZ, in totalAmount.
   * - calculate bridge's fee using the original amount to be sent.
   * - discount bridge's fee from the original amount, in amountMinusFees.
   * - add bridge's fee to `totalFeeReceivedBridge`, a variable to store all the fees received by the bridge.
   * - BRZ transfer totalAmount from the caller's address to bridge address.
   * - emit `CrossRequest` event, with the parameters:
   *   - from - address of the caller's function.
   *   - amount - the net amount to be transfered in the destination blockchain.
   *   - toFee - the gas price fee, which must be used to send the transfer transaction in the destination blockchain.
   *   - toAddress - string representing the address which will receive the tokens.
   *   - toBlockchain - the destination blockchain.
   *
   * > The `CrossRequest` event is very important because it must be listened by the monitor,

   *
   * - Blockchain / transaction fee in BRL (transactionFee[0])
   * It will be transfered from user's account,
   * along with the amount he would like to receive in the account.
   *
   * This will be spent in `toBlockchain`.
   * Does not depend of amount, but of destination blockchain.
   *
   * It must be at least the minBRZFee per blockchain.
   *
   * It is used in the function acceptTransfer,
   * which can not accept a BRZ fee less than minBRZFee (per blockchain).
   *
   * - gas price (transactionFee[1])
   * It must be at least the minGasPrice per blockchain.
   *
   * - Bridge Fee - it is deducted from the requested amount.
   * It is a percentage of the requested amount.
   * Cannot include the transaction fee in order to be calculated.
