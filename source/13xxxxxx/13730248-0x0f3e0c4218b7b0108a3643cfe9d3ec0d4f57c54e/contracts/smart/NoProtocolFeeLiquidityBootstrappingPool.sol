 * @dev The original Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool computes accumulated swap fees from invariant growth, which
 * incorrectly assumes that the token weights do not change. This version is an exact copy of that flawed contract, with
 * a hotfix that hard-codes the protocol fee swap percentage to 0, ignoring the value stored in the Fee Collector.
