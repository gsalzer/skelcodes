/// @notice This contract allows people to create a "Splitter" -> a contract that will
///         allow to split the ETH or ERC20 it received, between several addresses
///         This contract is upgradeable, because we might have to add functionalities
///         or versioning over time.
///         However, the Factory has no authority over a Splitter after it's created
///         which ensure that updates to the current contract
///         won't create any problems / exploits on existing Splitter
