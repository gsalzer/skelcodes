  * @title  PoolTogether V4 L1TimelockTrigger
  * @author PoolTogether Inc Team
  * @notice L1TimelockTrigger(s) acts as an intermediary between multiple V4 smart contracts.
            The L1TimelockTrigger is responsible for pushing Draws to a DrawBuffer and routing
            claim requests from a PrizeDistributor to a DrawCalculator. The primary objective is
            to  include a "cooldown" period for all new Draws. Allowing the correction of a
            malicously set Draw in the unfortunate event an Owner is compromised.
